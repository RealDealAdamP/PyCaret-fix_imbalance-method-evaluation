To Whom it May Concern:

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

I am writing to express my support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. 



This is an important step toward a change in marijuana policy that addresses the decades-long discrimination against Black and Brown communities. 



Taking marijuana out of the same classification as more harmful substances like methamphetamine and heroin will give a huge boost to cannabis researchers and those in the cannabis business, and set the stage for further reparative measures for impacted communities. 



Reclassifying marijuana is a necessary step that will move the needle in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy and I urge you to pass this new rule and push back against this nation’s archaic laws against cannabis possession. 



Thank you.

Unlike alcohol or benzodiazepines, marijuana does not lower your inhibitions-- in fact it makes you think twice about doing anything at all. Marijuana was instrumental in helping me stay off real drugs. I'm not saying marijuana is 'good for you', or it's not a mind altering substance, or that its not a drug but, it's no where near as harmful as something like alcohol (which, unlike marijuana, is very clearly a gateway drug because of it's tendency to lower inhibitions). I'm not a doctor and this is just my opinion based on my experience but, the doctor prescribing me marijuana seems to hold similar views.

Although I don't use marijuana much anymore, I believe governments decision to spend so much effort on prohibition is a symbol of its dysfunction and disconnect with reality. The prohibition of marijuana causes damage in many forms-- personal liberty, financial prosperity, helping black-market actors, incentives for illegal boarder crossing, adulterated products, and much more. But, one of the most poisonous things that prohibition reinforces is the wide held belief that US governments are ineffective and counter-productive. 

Rescheduling marijuana is a small step in the right direction towards common sense. Of course, I don't believe it should be totally unregulated or that anyone should drive under the influence of marijuana. But, keeping that plant in the same category as highly refined substances like heroin and LSD shows that the DEA is either inept, has ulterior motives, or uses poor council. The problem isn't the plethora of theories about why governments make such strange judgments but it's the faltering of credibility. People need theories to justify strange actions (like marijuana's current scheduling) because they want to keep the baseline belief that their government agencies are meticulously effective. Theories use that baseline belief paired with the knowledge that marijuana is not very harmful of and ask the question, ""What is the goal?-- is it racism? partnering with cartels? Filling the prisons?"" and equally strange ideas for the strange judgment.
It would be much better to take actions that reinforce the belief that agencies are meticulously effective but lead people to the conclusion that the DEA's (and other agencies) mission is one of positive outcomes for US citizens. I think those reinforcing actions would have far reaching implications beyond the DEA's purview. ",Unclear,0.1399610758894495

While I acknowledge the complexities involved in cannabis regulation, I firmly believe that reclassification is not the right approach at this time for several reasons.

First, there are significant concerns about abuse. I have observed instances where individuals misuse cannabis, which can lead to accidents and even fatalities. Additionally, cannabis use can act as a gateway to the consumption of more powerful and dangerous drugs.

Second, the pervasive smell of cannabis is problematic. It affects the quality of life in communities and can be particularly troublesome in shared or public spaces.

Given these issues, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposal and explore alternative approaches that address these concerns more effectively.

DEA-2024-0059-15635,2024-06-11T04:00Z,Anonymous,"The current proposal to move cannabis to Schedule III does not legalize cannabis nor does it eliminate the legal penalties Americans face for consuming the product. So first and foremost, this proposal does not fulfill President Biden's pledge to ""Legalize Marijuana"". 

It is plain to anyone looking at the state of cannnabis laws in our country that it does not reflect the will of the people nor it's perception of what it means to live ina free society. The very fact polls are so disconnected with the rhetoric of our political class and administrative state is proof enough that the government is not in alignment with it's citizens. That's problem lies with the government, not the citizens.

Look at prohibition. How'd that go? Alcohol is one of the worst substances you can put in your body, and yet we allow it. In fact, there is no choice but to allow people to make their own decisions and deal with the consequences. 

So, what is the peoblem you are looking to solve by moving cannabis to Schedule III? So researchers at pharmaceutical companies can patent new drugs that they can sell to people? Is it not obvious that the issue is you have a plant that is overwhelmingly popular, and has been for thousands of years, and can be accessed directly, without an authoritative body. 

Why does the governments rhetoric seem so ignorant to those familiar with cannabis. Why do so many Americans think cannabis should be legal while the government insists there should be dire legal consequences for accessing a plant. 

The very creation of the CSA, and the politically motivated prohibition of cannabis, is the cause of our current state. As a result, a vast swath of the population has been rendered criminal. Good, hard working people, who we're told they live a free country. 

My general proposals for cannabis are as follows:
It should not be in the CSA. 
Individuals can cultivate, posess, sell or give away cannabis
Companies should be able to produce abd sell cannabis and strict quality controls should be in place. 
There should be protections in place to keep the underage away from cannabis. 
There should be robust restrictions in place around the advertising of cannabis. 
Rules that prevent monopolies and predatory behavior by companies. 

Any action short of allowing Americans to make their own decisions on cannabis is furtherance of an agenda by which the government systematically makes an enemy of it's people. 

Again, President Biden pledged to ""Legalize Marijuana"".  Are you going to legalize it or not? Because as of now, that pledge has not been fulfilled.  The owness is on you to deliver, you being the administrative bodies that serve the people. So understand the very conversation around this topic is so frought with governmental weaponization, that you as the so called authority have a significant credibility gap to bridge. That's on you, not the people. 

The advent of cannabis decriminilization will come to pass, one way or another.  If it were not, we would not be having this conversation. So the real question is, will you seize this opportunity to right past wrongs and take a step towards restoring your credibility, or will you serve the agenda of drug companies, industrial incarceration, and politicians.

DEA-2024-0059-39654,2024-07-22T04:00Z,Herbal Edibles & Extracts,"Cannabis should be De-scheduled.  
Cannabis Must Be Descheduled!

Because:

1)       Reclassifying cannabis to Schedule III within the CSA continues to misrepresent the plant’s safety relative to other controlled substances such as anabolic steroids and ketamine (Schedule III), benzodiazepines (Schedule IV), or even alcohol and tobacco, which are unscheduled.

2)       Moving cannabis to Schedule III is out of step with public and cultural consensus. Americans don’t want cannabis treated like heroin, like it is now. Still, they also don’t want it treated like a Schedule III substance like ketamine, which is only legal to possess with a physician’s prescription. 

3)      And most importantly, this proposed change does little to address the widening divide between state-legal marijuana laws and federal law. Every state law that is currently in conflict with federal law today will remain in conflict with federal law going forward when or if the Administration reclassifies cannabis as a Schedule III substance.
That is why, descheduling cannabis removing it from the CSA altogether thereby providing state governments rather than the federal government the ability to regulate marijuana as they see fit, without violating federal law.

DEA-2024-0059-18335,2024-06-17T04:00Z,Douglas Hoppe,"I am providing comments in support of the reclassification of botanical cannabis (Docket No. DEA–1362). Schedule III is a good first step but ideally it should be completely discheduled on the Federal level. 

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.

I have been a daily user of Cannabis for many years to treat my chronic pain, inflammation and my insomnia.   it is cheap and effective medicine,  and relatively nontoxic.  It is not a very dangerous substance. 

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether – thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states – I nonetheless do not oppose the factual basis underlying HHS’ recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower. It would be arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to reject HHS’s findings of fact and to maintain existing prohibitions of the cannabis plant.

if it is possible to deschedule cannabis completely,  it would be the right thing to do and should be done as soon as possible.  If it is not possible yet,  then schedule III or creating a new special schedule for cannabis,   would be a good next step.  ",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,0.901714112903602

I am writing to express my strong support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. This is an important and necessary step towards modernizing our nation's drug policies, reflecting current scientific understanding of cannabis' potential benefits and harms.



For too long, marijuana has been categorized alongside highly dangerous substances like methamphetamine, despite mounting evidence suggesting its relative safety. Reclassifying it to Schedule III would not only acknowledge this reality but also pave the way for further research into its medicinal properties and potential risks.



Furthermore, reclassification would provide much-needed regulatory clarity for businesses operating within the burgeoning cannabis industry. The tax benefits that stand to accrue from such a move could stimulate economic growth and job creation in communities across America.



I urge you to consider these points as you review this critical proposal. Reclassifying marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act is a commonsense move that aligns with both public sentiment and scientific evidence. It represents another significant step forward in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy.

Moving cannabis into a category of drugs that have a low risk of dependence gives the public false information about this drug.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and the World Health Organization have all acknowledged that marijuana is much more potent than ever before. In the 1970s, the THC level in marijuana products was only 2%, but today the level is up to 18%-35% THC. Items such as gummies, drinks, and candies containing cannabis make this vice more appealing and easier to consume. The increased THC amounts plus the ease of consuming it has led to an uptick in cannabis use disorders, schizophrenia, and cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. 

The well-being of children is at risk. Teen use of marijuana is at an all-time high with 30% of high school seniors having used cannabis. Emergency room visits are on the rise with the large majority of psychiatric events caused by marijuana use.

Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.

Also, keeping tens of thousands of good truck drivers off the road due to failed drug tests for THC is a complete and total disgrace.

Also, urine testing should be banned and mouth swabs should be implemented across the board for drug testing since urine tests are considered a minimally invasive procedure and can be easily tampered with. The FMCSA itself said that saliva tests cost less to the employer and doesn't look back as far for marijuana since THC can be detected in urine for weeks or months after its use. Keeping truck drivers who use THC products responsibly and do not use or get high on the job off the road because they simply failed a urine test for THC is a flawed analogy.

This is an important step toward a change in marijuana policy that addresses the decades-long discrimination against Black and Brown communities. 



Taking marijuana out of the same classification as more harmful substances like methamphetamine and heroin will give a huge boost to cannabis researchers and those in the cannabis business, and set the stage for further reparative measures for impacted communities. 



Reclassifying marijuana is a necessary step that will move the needle in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy and I urge you to pass this new rule and push back against this nation’s archaic laws against cannabis possession.

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs.

HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

We as a society have allowed alcohol to be purchased legally. But it kills many people each year. Why is it still legal? Because as a society we trust each other to make responsible choices when it comes to alcohol. We should have the same trusting attitude for those who choose Marijuana.
Besides the trust factor, legalization will stop money flowing to drug cartels who use that money in illegal and violent ways.

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.

While I appreciate the Biden Administration’s efforts to reconsider marijuana’s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it’s time to end this country’s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA’s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.

Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients’ access to medical marijuana. 

Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won’t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.

The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or “descheduling.” Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. 

Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana’s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. 

Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.

Given the Biden Administration’s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.

President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden’s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA..

I am a 75 year old male, and have been consuming cannabis in various forms since 1966, the year of my high school graduation. 
Cannabis has been a pleasant, helpful substance that I enjoy. I have never experienced a medical emergency due to cannabis consumption.  
Now in my later years, I eat 15 mg of THC before strenuous two-hour YMCA exercise classes, four times a week. This keeps me in good physical shape.
Exercise makes my muscles sore – DOMS. I eat THC to relieve that soreness and pain.  I could not maintain my vigorous exercise schedule without pain relief from cannabis. 
Americans are substituting cannabis products for opioids and other harmful prescription drugs. I myself was able to beat nicotine addiction 19 years ago with the help of cannabis substitution. I’d be dead if I had kept smoking cigarettes.
There is no legitimate reason to deny cannabis medicine to Americans. Cost savings to government health plans (Medicare, Medicaid) will be enormous. Health insurance companies will see costs plummet once cannabis is prescribed by doctors. 
Friends from high school and college were drafted and sent to Vietnam. Some died there. Most came back with grim memories. Some of my closest friends can’t sleep without a puff or two of cannabis. There is no reason to deny our military veterans access to THC cannabis. 
Cannabis is not for everyone. If you don’t like it, don’t consume it.  It is not addictive.
Please move biological cannabis THC to Schedule III.

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

I am writing to express my strong support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. This is an important and necessary step towards modernizing our nation's drug policies, reflecting current scientific understanding of cannabis' potential benefits and harms.



For too long, marijuana has been categorized alongside highly dangerous substances like methamphetamine, despite mounting evidence suggesting its relative safety. Reclassifying it to Schedule III would not only acknowledge this reality but also pave the way for further research into its medicinal properties and potential risks.



Furthermore, reclassification would provide much-needed regulatory clarity for businesses operating within the burgeoning cannabis industry. The tax benefits that stand to accrue from such a move could stimulate economic growth and job creation in communities across America.



I urge you to consider these points as you review this critical proposal. Reclassifying marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act is a commonsense move that aligns with both public sentiment and scientific evidence. It represents another significant step forward in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy.

That the Plant has many benefits. As a person who lives in a state (Florida) that has had a medical marijuana program since 2014, as a lifetime consumer and cannabis-hemp-licensed cultivator. I have never found the need nor believed that the expenses warranted to become a medical marijuana patient ($100 to $420 physician visit (every 7 months) + $75 annual OMMU ID Card) were in my best interest or my budget. As a licensed grower of the cannabis plant, Schedule III concerns me. We grow organically, meaning no chemical applications are applied to our plants (no performance growth regulators PGRs, herbicides, pesticides, or fungicides). Schedule III encourages more chemists to enter the grow space. This concerns me as there are reports of labs discussing Genetically Modifying Plants. Exactly the practices we are trying to discourage to reverse the decades of industrialization of agricultural products by supporting USDA Organic and Naturally Grown Programs. Through regenerative techniques and climate-smart agricultural practices that emphasize the importance of conservation and preservation to protect our natural resources. Resources that have been devastated by chemical applications and cannabis eradication programs that have significantly contributed to the decimation of lands in the U.S., Mexico, Central and South America.   

Removing Cannabis-Marihuana-Marijuana from the list of Controlled Substances is the only step forward. In Florida the non-refundable fee to apply as a Medical Marijuana Treatment Center (MMTC) is $60,043, and because Pigford v Glickman Re: Black Farmers that sued the USDA over discriminatory practices were granted one MMTC license and were charged $146,000 (non-refundable application fee). As of December 2022, all MMTC applicants are charged $146,000 to apply for a vertical license (to grow-manufacture, retail sell, process, and distribute). We advocated for a no cost $0 cannabis-hemp cultivation license. Hemp cultivators must pass Level 2 Background Screenings. And the annual fee to distribute, process, and retail hemp-derived products is $650 per application. As growers that also work with legacy growers. Legacy growers have been growing cannabis-marijuana underground since the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, etc. will not benefit from rescheduling to a Schedule III.  

The 2018 Agriculture and Improvement Act removed the Cannabis plant and all the Cannabinoids including delta-9-THC (at 0.3%) from the Controlled Substances Act. Prior to passage of the 2018 Farm Bill. Your agency, the Drug Enforcement Administration, did not classify cannabis-marijuana at 5% THC or under as a Controlled Substance. This fascinating fact increases my opinion that the only logical next step is to remove the last remaining cannabinoid delta-9-THC percentage from the Controlled Substances Act.

DEA-2024-0059-30969,2024-07-16T04:00Z,Jessica Craven,"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the DEA’s proposed rule change, which would
reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). 

I am writing to express my concerns with this proposed rule. While I appreciate the Administration’s
recognition that marijuana should be removed from Schedule I, this proposed rule falls short and
ultimately will not reduce the decades of damage caused by the criminalization of
marijuana. Furthermore, the proposed rule misses an opportunity to align federal policy with where
much of the country is headed, and is completely out of step with where most Americans are on this
issue. Rather than rescheduling, I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and instead issue a
rule that would completely deschedule marijuana from the CSA.

Marijuana was initially included in the CSA pending a study and review by the National Commission
on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, better known as the Shafer Commission, over 50 years ago. That
study concluded that marijuana was no more dangerous than alcohol and recommended that it be
decriminalized. Nixon rejected this recommendation, and his domestic policy chief was later quoted
as saying this decision was predicated on a desire to weaponize criminalization and the so called
“War on Drugs” to target Black and Brown people and anti-war protestors. He stated: “We could
arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on
the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course, we did.”
We know the devastation this “War on Drugs” has wreaked on Black and Brown communities. In all
50 states, Black people are more likely to be arrested for marijuana offenses than white people,
despite similar usage rates. I can tell you from personal experience that this is true--when I was 15 years old I was picked up by the cops in New York City for buying pot. They let me--a white, cute young girl--off with a warning. If I'd been Black I could still be in jail!

On average across the nation, a Black person is nearly four times as likely to be arrested for a marijuana offense than a white person. While often touted for its
liberalism, in New York City 94 percent of all people arrested for marijuana offenses are people of
color. The last 50 years has taught us that we cannot achieve racial justice so long as this “War on
Drugs” is allowed to rage.

In addition to the racial injustice linked to criminalizing marijuana, the continued criminalization of
marijuana is incredibly fiscally irresponsible. Forty percent of all drug arrests in the U.S. are for
marijuana offenses, overwhelmingly for simple possession. In fact, arrests for marijuana outnumber
arrests for all violent crimes combined. It is estimated that the U.S. spends upwards of $7.6 billion
annually on the criminalization of marijuana. Putting aside the real harms caused by
criminalization, this is an enormous amount of taxpayer money that could be put to far better use.
This money could be used to fund schools, mental health and substance abuse services, proper
nutrition for families, and youth programming. Missouri legalized marijuana in 2020, and it is
projected that by the end of 2024 it will have generated $238 million in tax revenue. The state uses
that money to fund drug treatment, veteran services, and other important social programs. In
another example, Colorado generated $1.6 billion in tax revenue within a six-year period to fund
schools, literacy programs, and mental health services.
Widespread acceptance of marijuana has increased tremendously in recent decades. Twenty-four
states have completely legalized recreational marijuana, and over half of Americans live in a state
where it is legal. Another 14 states have legalized the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes. In
one of the most obvious signs that legalization is working, not a single state has reversed its
legalization of marijuana. Furthermore, 88 percent of Americans support legalization for either
recreational or medical use. And more than half of Americans state they have used marijuana,
making enforcement even more arbitrary.
States have long been considered the “laboratories of democracy,” the federal government should
follow the success of these states, and the will of the American people and deschedule marijuana.
Federal descheduling will demonstrate leadership in helping clear the path for the remaining states
to decriminalize marijuana, a crucial step in reducing the overcriminalization of Black and Brown
people.

deschedule marijuana. ",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,0.9740477519685292

We urge the Drug Enforcement Agency to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act, a move that would mark a step toward rectifying the harms caused by its criminalization. 

By rescheduling cannabis, the federal government would be following the lead of 31 states that have already decriminalized the drug. The majority of people in the U.S.—70 percent, according to a November 2023 Gallup poll—support cannabis legalization. 

But rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, as the Department of Health & Human Services and the DEA have proposed, is insufficient. If cannabis remains on the CSA, people can continue to face penalties at the federal level for possession, including arrest and incarceration, which lead to a lifetime of consequences that impact someone’s ability to secure employment, housing, public benefits, educational opportunities, and more. 

The criminalization of cannabis—a legacy of the War on Drugs—was a policy decision rooted in racism. In the decades since its enforcement has been disproportionately targeted at Black people and other people of color. It’s time to abandon this draconian approach.

Rescheduling marijuana would allow the marijuana industry to begin deducting normal business expenses, including advertising and marketing expenses. This would make the industry enormously profitable and incentivize them to spend even more on advertising and marketing.  With this, we can expect marijuana sales to grow exponentially, and harms associated with marijuana use to rise in tandem. Big Tobacco taught us all too well the deleterious impact of advertising on youth: the more teens are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely they are to start smoking. The same will be true with marijuana. The marijuana industry will undoubtedly take a page out of Big Tobacco’s marketing playbook, making marijuana use look glamorous and benign with celebrity endorsements, candy flavoring (already seen in marijuana edibles), product placement in movies, and more. 

Perhaps most alarming: even without the expected deluge of ads and slick marketing, marijuana use is at an all-time high. Teen use of marijuana is at 30- year high, with more teens reporting smoking marijuana than tobacco. Among young adults 19 to 30, 26% used in the past month compared to 17% in 2011, and 11% were daily users, up from 6% in 2011. 

The recommendation from HHS failed to take into account actual/relative potential for abuse or harms associated with use. Contrary to popular narrative, marijuana can be addictive; In fact, as many as 1 in 3 past year marijuana users met the clinical criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder. People who self-medicate with marijuana are not exempt from becoming addicted to it. According to research at Massachusetts General Hospital, “using cannabis products to treat pain, anxiety and depression failed to improve these symptoms while doubling the risk of developing the addictive symptoms of cannabis use disorder.” 

With the exception of one study of medical marijuana patients in Maryland, the review from HHS failed to acknowledge or consider the link between marijuana and psychosis. This is especially concerning in light of the rising potency of marijuana. Daily users of marijuana over 10% THC are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than non-users. A 2023 study in Denmark determined that 30 percent of cases of schizophrenia among 21–30-year-old males could have been averted if cannabis use disorder had been prevented. A 2022 study found that hospital discharges for marijuana-associated psychosis were higher in states with legal marijuana, another precursor if those who push full-scale commercialization have their way. 

Marijuana use is especially concerning in young people, a factor HHS failed to adequately address. The National Center for Education Statistics said, “adolescent marijuana use has been associated with lower academic performance and a higher risk of dropping out of high school.”  Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, warns, “Youth who use marijuana regularly are more likely to have a hard time learning, problems remembering, and lower math and reading scores. These effects can last weeks after the last time they used marijuana.” Recognizing that much remains unknown about marijuana, NIDA noted, “researchers are still studying how long marijuana’s effects last and whether some changes may be permanent.” 

Finally, while some states recognize “medical marijuana” there is, in fact, no currently accepted medical use. Unlike other drugs in Schedule III, marijuana is not FDA approved to treat or cure any disease and it is not available for prescription in any state. In 2023, the American Medical Association adopted a position statement that “encourages hospitals and health systems to: (a) not recommend patient use of non-FDA approved cannabis or cannabis-derived products within healthcare facilities until such time as federal laws or regulations permit its use; and (b) educate medical staffs on cannabis use, effects and cannabis withdrawal syndrome.”

DEA-2024-0059-36723,2024-07-22T04:00Z,Marcy Gallup,"Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEA’s proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administration’s efforts to reconsider marijuana’s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it’s time to end this country’s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA’s drug schedules. I urge the DEokA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.

Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients’ access to medical marijuana. 

Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won’t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.

The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or “descheduling.” Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. 

Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana’s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. 

Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.

Given the Biden Administration’s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.

President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden’s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization.

My brother died a premature death due to doctors getting him hooked on pain pills, for the Rheumatoid Arthritis that they missed diagnosing for years.  It was the only relief he could find, and as with most additive drugs he had to keep taking more to kill the pain.  It ate him up alive.  Not the RA, the addiction.
When this started I was living in Phoenix, AZ and we had just legalized medical weed.  He flew out for a few visits before he got real bad; after a 3 week stay and using cannabis instead of pills, he was down to 2-3 pills a day from 12.  Once back home in Illinois he was forced to go back on the pills.  I firmly believe that had he been able to continue with cannabis, he may still be with us today and the Humira may have stood a chance of working to control the RA.  I myself have used medical cannabis for several years now, and have been able to eliminate 4 other meds while better controlling my depression and PTSD (with the additional help of my psychologist who is on board with my cannabis usage).  It's also helped me get my digestive issues corrected by relieving a lot of the stress that causes my over-production of stomach acids.

DEA-2024-0059-24114,2024-06-23T04:00Z,Tia Fonseca,"To transfer marijuana from schedule 1 of Controlled Substances Act to schedule 3 would be beneficial in more ways than one. It is known now that marijuana Is not only used for recreational purposes. Many people have come forth and decided to use cannabis to treat some conditions. In “Prevalence of Medical and Nonmedical Cannabis Use Among Veterans in Primary Care” it is noted that 1 in 5 of veterans said they used cannabis medically and recreationally. They were also found to be less likely to use other drugs classified on schedule 1. 
Cannabis is also the most commonly used drug, compared to other schedule 1 drugs. There are currently 23 states in the USA that have legalized marijuana. You are able to use it for recreational purposes and also for and medical reasons. While almost half of the state’s listed cancer as a medical condition that would allow a person use of cannabis.  Other conditions included were conditions like hepatitis C, glaucoma, and multiple sclerosis. We also have seen the use of cannabis increase when it comes to Palliative care. With this type of care, they aim to manage the symptoms and bring comfort. Cannabis has been used and has shown, with the limited research that has been done, to help. Research has found that it may have improved cancer-related pain, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, appetite and chemosensory changes, insomnia, and mood disorders. With the schedule change, it opens up so many more opportunities for research to be done further and more in depth to find out how much of an impact medical use marijuana does have on certain medical conditions. 
Not only would legalization and the transfer of marijuana on the CSA, help with medical conditions, but it has also been shown to reduce overdoses on other drugs that are categorized

DEA-2024-0059-6744,2024-05-29T04:00Z,Cyndahl Hoyt,"To Whom it May Concern:

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

I urge the Drug Enforcement Agency to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act, a move that would mark a step toward rectifying the harms caused by its criminalization. 

By descheduling cannabis, the federal government would be following the lead of 31 states that have already decriminalized the drug. In fact, the majority of people in the U.S. (i.e., around 70 percent, according to a November 2023 Gallup poll) support cannabis legalization. 

But rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, as the Department of Health & Human Services and the DEA have proposed, is insufficient. If cannabis remains on the CSA, people can continue to face penalties at the federal level for possession, including arrest and incarceration, which lead to a lifetime of consequences that impact someone’s ability to secure employment, housing, public benefits, educational opportunities, and more. As has been demonstrated thoroughly in the academic literature, this creates a vicious cycle that not only harms tax payers, but also continues to place additional burdens on and barriers in front of people being impacted by cannabis criminalization.

In reference to (Docket No. DEA–1362) I am writing to support the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) recommendation to 
reclassify marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III. The HHS appropriately concluded that cannabis “has
a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either 
a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. 
Cannabis has a currently accepted medical use, and its abuse potential does not warrant its classification
as a Schedule I substance. HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread 
understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific 
conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical 
supervision. Over 30,000 healthcare practitioners in 38 states recommend it to more than six million 
registered patients, making marijuana’s medical use in treatment and its medical application crystal 
clear. Surveys of healthcare professionals, such as a 2022 study by the CDC, show that over two-thirds 
believe in its medical use, and numerous medical associations support legal access to cannabis for 
medical purposes. 
HHS’s review accurately finds cannabis to be safer than many other controlled substances, and cannabis 
clearly does not meet the criteria of a Schedule I or II substance. Cannabis poses lower public health 
risks compared to Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine, and compared to 
Schedule IV drugs like benzodiazepine. Cannabis also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of 
physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. This low public health risk of 
cannabis is well supported based on a robust evaluation of epidemiological evidence, including overdose
deaths.
Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to 
other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines, a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled.” 
HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical 
use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible 
scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”
Extensive clinical research—including FDA-approved trials—and widespread medical treatment in the 
United States support the medical efficacy and low abuse potential of cannabis. Based on this evidence, 
cannabis should be rescheduled to Schedule III to reflect its medical benefits and relative safety. While 
complete removal from the Controlled Substances Act would better promote public health and safety 
and align federal policy with state laws, I support and believe the medical evidence and factual basis 
support HHS’s recommendation to reschedule cannabis to Schedule III.",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,0.9944981898967258

While there have been discussions about moving marijuana to Schedule III, this classification is still too restrictive given its proven medicinal properties and low potential for abuse compared to other substances.

Therapeutic Benefits
Marijuana has been extensively studied for its potential therapeutic benefits, which can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with various health issues. For instance:

	1.	Chronic Pain Management: Marijuana has been shown to be effective in alleviating chronic pain, which is often resistant to other forms of treatment. For individuals suffering from conditions such as arthritis, multiple sclerosis, or fibromyalgia, marijuana can provide significant relief without the side effects associated with opioid painkillers.
	2.	Mental Health Conditions: Many individuals find that marijuana helps manage symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Its calming effects can reduce the severity of anxiety attacks and improve overall mood, providing an alternative to traditional pharmaceuticals that may have undesirable side effects.
	3.	Nausea and Appetite Stimulation: For patients undergoing chemotherapy or those with conditions like HIV/AIDS, marijuana can help manage nausea and stimulate appetite, improving nutritional intake and overall health.

Low Potential for Abuse
Marijuana has a lower potential for abuse compared to many substances classified under Schedule III, such as anabolic steroids and certain prescription medications. Numerous studies have indicated that marijuana dependence is less severe than dependence on alcohol, nicotine, or opioids. Furthermore, the risk of fatal overdose with marijuana is virtually nonexistent, making it a safer alternative for managing various health conditions.

Barriers to Access
Maintaining marijuana as a Schedule III drug would continue to impose significant barriers to access. Under Schedule III, marijuana would still be subject to stringent regulatory controls, limiting its availability to patients who need it. These barriers can prevent timely access to necessary treatment, exacerbating health conditions and reducing quality of life.

The Need for Reclassification
Given its therapeutic benefits, low potential for abuse, and the need for broader access, marijuana should be reclassified to a lower schedule or removed from the scheduling system entirely. This reclassification would facilitate more research into its medical uses, improve accessibility for patients, and align legal standards with scientific evidence.

Conclusion
For individuals dealing with chronic pain, mental health issues, and other conditions, marijuana offers a viable and often superior alternative to conventional treatments. Reclassifying marijuana to a lower schedule would recognize its medicinal value, reduce barriers to access, and ultimately support the health and well-being of countless individuals. By advocating for this change, we can ensure that more people have the opportunity to benefit from the therapeutic potential of marijuana.

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether – thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states – I nonetheless do not oppose the factual basis underlying HHS’ recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower. It would be arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to reject HHS’s findings of fact and to maintain existing prohibitions of the cannabis plant.

The Department of Health and Human Services has rightly concluded that cannabis ""has a currently accepted medical use"" and that its potential for abuse does not justify its classification as a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

My initial interest in cannabis research was sparked by its evident therapeutic benefits, which I observed firsthand. This personal experience aligns with the widespread acknowledgment within the medical community regarding cannabis's effectiveness in treating specific conditions such as pain, and its comparatively safe administration under medical supervision.

Currently, thirty-eight states have established regulations for the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. Approximately six million patients and 30,000 healthcare practitioners participate in these state programs, which have been in operation for many years without any state repealing patient access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This demonstrates that medical cannabis can be regulated both safely and effectively.

A significant majority of healthcare professionals recognize the medical utility of cannabis. According to 2022 survey data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 69 percent of clinicians believe in the medical benefits of cannabis, and over a quarter have recommended it to their patients. Furthermore, several prestigious medical societies and associations have urged the federal government to legalize cannabis as a medicine.

Cannabis has a notably superior safety profile compared to many controlled substances and does not fulfill the stringent criteria for inclusion under Schedule I or II. HHS has specifically noted that the public health risks associated with marijuana are minimal, especially when compared to substances like benzodiazepines—a Schedule IV drug—or unscheduled substances such as alcohol.

In conclusion, based on both personal observations and extensive research, I firmly support the reclassification of cannabis to at least Schedule III. It would be both arbitrary and unreasonable for the DEA to disregard the HHS's findings and continue to prohibit botanical cannabis.

Citizens are now well-informed and aware that the harms of marijuana use are quite low, and that the consequences of prohibition have been dire and pervasive, and by no means proportional to actual harm.

Many citizens also feel a sense of betrayal at the deceptive practices the government has engaged in to garner public support for criminalization.

In the hospital the doctors referred to it as CIP - Cannabis Induced Disorder.  This is a powerful and potentially dangerous drug for millions of young peope that should definitely not be re-scheduled.

I am writing to register my opposition to the recommendation to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. 

Rescheduling marijuana would allow the marijuana industry to deduct normal business expenses, including advertising and marketing expenses. This would make the industry profitable and incentivize them to spend even more on advertising and marketing.  This would likely cause marijuana sales and the harms associated with marijuana use to rise in tandem. Big Tobacco taught us the deleterious impact of advertising on youth: the more teens are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely they are to start smoking. The same will be true with marijuana. The marijuana industry will undoubtedly take a page out of Big Tobacco’s marketing playbook, making marijuana use look glamorous and benign with celebrity endorsements, candy flavoring (already seen in marijuana edibles), product placement in movies, and more. Even without the expected deluge of ads and marketing, marijuana use is at an all-time high. Teen use of marijuana is at 30- year high, with more teens reporting smoking marijuana than tobacco. Among young adults 19 to 30, 26% used in the past month compared to 17% in 2011, and 11% were daily users, up from 6% in 2011. 

HHS' recommendation failed to account for actual/relative potential for abuse or harms associated with use. Contrary to popular narrative, marijuana can be addictive. In fact, as many as 1 in 3 past year marijuana users met the clinical criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder. People who self-medicate with marijuana are not exempt from becoming addicted. According to research at Massachusetts General Hospital, “using cannabis products to treat pain, anxiety and depression failed to improve these symptoms while doubling the risk of developing the addictive symptoms of cannabis use disorder.” 

With the exception of one study of medical marijuana patients in Maryland, the review from HHS failed to acknowledge or consider the link between marijuana and psychosis. This is especially concerning in light of the rising potency of marijuana. Daily users of marijuana over 10% THC are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than non-users. A 2023 study in Denmark determined that 30% of cases of schizophrenia among 21–30-year-old males could have been averted if cannabis use disorder had been prevented. A 2022 study found that hospital discharges for marijuana-associated psychosis were higher in states with legal marijuana, another precursor if those who push full-scale commercialization have their way. 

Marijuana use is especially concerning in young people, a factor HHS failed to adequately address. The National Center for Education Statistics said, “adolescent marijuana use has been associated with lower academic performance and a higher risk of dropping out of high school.”  Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, warns, “Youth who use marijuana regularly are more likely to have a hard time learning, problems remembering, and lower math and reading scores. These effects can last weeks after the last time they used marijuana.” Recognizing that much remains unknown about marijuana, NIDA noted, “researchers are still studying how long marijuana’s effects last and whether some changes may be permanent.” 

Finally, while some states recognize “medical marijuana” there is no currently accepted medical use. Unlike other drugs in Schedule III, marijuana is not FDA approved to treat or cure any disease and it is not available for prescription in any state. In 2023, the American Medical Association adopted a position statement that “encourages hospitals and health systems to: (a) not recommend patient use of non-FDA approved cannabis or cannabis-derived products within healthcare facilities until such time as federal laws or regulations permit its use; and (b) educate medical staffs on cannabis use, effects and cannabis withdrawal syndrome.”

You probably cannot take the time to read all of this, so I included only a subset of what was suggested to write to you.  It is time to drop all charges for marijuana use.

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the DEA’s proposed rule change, which would
reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). I
am writing to express my concerns with this proposed rule. While I appreciate the Administration’s
recognition that marijuana should be removed from Schedule I, this proposed rule falls short and
ultimately will not reduce the decades of damage caused by the criminalization of
marijuana. Furthermore, the proposed rule misses an opportunity to align federal policy with where
much of the country is headed, and is completely out of step with where most Americans are on this
issue. Rather than rescheduling, I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and instead issue a
rule that would completely deschedule marijuana from the CSA.
Marijuana was initially included in the CSA pending a study and review by the National Commission
on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, better known as the Shafer Commission, over 50 years ago. That
study concluded that marijuana was no more dangerous than alcohol and recommended that it be
decriminalized. Nixon rejected this recommendation, and his domestic policy chief was later quoted
as saying this decision was predicated on a desire to weaponize criminalization and the so called
“War on Drugs” to target Black and Brown people and anti-war protestors. He stated: “We could
arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on
the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course, we did.”
We know the devastation this “War on Drugs” has wreaked on Black and Brown communities. In all
50 states, Black people are more likely to be arrested for marijuana offenses than white people,
despite similar usage rates. On average across the nation, a Black person is nearly four times as
likely to be arrested for a marijuana offense than a white person. While often touted for its
liberalism, in New York City 94 percent of all people arrested for marijuana offenses are people of
color. The last 50 years has taught us that we cannot achieve racial justice so long as this “War on
Drugs” is allowed to rage.  ",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,0.9686165028911566

I am writing to express my strong support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. This is an important and necessary step towards modernizing our nation's drug policies, reflecting current scientific understanding of cannabis' potential benefits and harms.



For too long, marijuana has been categorized alongside highly dangerous substances like methamphetamine, despite mounting evidence suggesting its relative safety. Reclassifying it to Schedule III would not only acknowledge this reality but also pave the way for further research into its medicinal properties and potential risks.



Furthermore, reclassification would provide much-needed regulatory clarity for businesses operating within the burgeoning cannabis industry. The tax benefits that stand to accrue from such a move could stimulate economic growth and job creation in communities across America.



I urge you to consider these points as you review this critical proposal. Reclassifying marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act is a commonsense move that aligns with both public sentiment and scientific evidence. It represents another significant step forward in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy.

Not something to be proud of. The literal boot of the only president to ever resign.

I urge the Drug Enforcement Agency to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act, a move that would mark a step toward rectifying the harms caused by its criminalization. 

By descheduling cannabis, the federal government would be following the lead of 31 states that have already decriminalized the drug. In fact, the majority of people in the U.S.—70 percent, according to a November 2023 Gallup poll—support cannabis legalization. 

But rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, as the Department of Health & Human Services and the DEA have proposed, is insufficient. If cannabis remains on the CSA, people can continue to face penalties at the federal level for possession, including arrest and incarceration, which lead to a lifetime of consequences that impact someone’s ability to secure employment, housing, public benefits, educational opportunities, and more. 
The criminalization of cannabis—a legacy of the War on Drugs—was a policy decision rooted in racism. In the decades since, its enforcement has been disproportionately targeted at Black people and other people of color. It’s time to abandon this draconian approach. I support descheduling cannabis from the CSA—a step toward righting the wrongs of its criminalization.

I honestly think it should be legal, but … baby steps.  I want you to explain how alcohol is legal yet marijuana is not.  In your hearts you all know it makes absolutely no sense!

Dear Administrator,

I am writing to you regarding the proposed rulemaking by the Department of Justice to transfer marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), as published on May 20, 2024. While I appreciate the efforts to recognize the medical use of marijuana and its potential for abuse relative to substances in Schedules I and II, I believe that full legalization is a more appropriate course of action.

The current proposal acknowledges the accepted medical use of marijuana and its lower potential for abuse compared to other controlled substances. However, maintaining marijuana as a Schedule III substance still imposes unnecessary barriers to its access and research. Full legalization would align federal policy with the growing consensus among states that have already recognized the therapeutic benefits of cannabis and have established their own regulatory frameworks.

Moreover, the continued criminalization of marijuana disproportionately affects marginalized communities, contributing to social and racial injustices. Full legalization would help rectify these disparities and allow for the expungement of records for those previously convicted of non-violent cannabis offenses.

I urge the DEA to consider the broader implications of marijuana scheduling and to take bold steps towards full legalization. This would not only reflect the current scientific understanding and public opinion but also promote social equity, economic growth, and public health.

Thank you for your consideration of this matter. I look forward to the opportunity to engage further on this important issue.

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.

As it stands, cannabis is classified as a Schedule I substance, placing it alongside the most dangerous and addictive drugs known to humanity. This categorization not only ignores the extensive scientific evidence demonstrating the medical benefits of cannabis but also perpetuates a cycle of injustice and stigma that harms countless individuals.

Cannabis has shown remarkable potential in treating a variety of conditions, from chronic pain and epilepsy to PTSD and cancer-related symptoms. For many patients, it offers relief where conventional medications have failed, providing a path to improved quality of life. Denying access to this natural remedy based on outdated and disproven notions is not only cruel but also counterproductive to our collective health and well-being.

Furthermore, the current scheduling of cannabis has led to a disproportionate impact on marginalized communities.

While this is a step in the right direction, it is crucial to consider the broader implications and the necessity for more comprehensive reforms. Below, I outline several points and suggestions for your consideration:

1. Rescheduling vs. Descheduling:
Rescheduling cannabis to Schedule III is a significant move but does not address the overarching issues related to cannabis criminalization. Descheduling and full legalization of cannabis is a political process that requires congressional action. I urge lawmakers to pass the CAOA, the HOPE Act, the MORE Act, or the States Reform Act to fully legalize cannabis and address the harms of prohibition.

2. Executive Clemency:
Regardless of cannabis’s classification, the President has the power to commute sentences for those serving federal cannabis-related sentences. I urge the President and state governors to exercise their executive clemency powers to release all individuals incarcerated for cannabis offenses. This action would be a significant step towards justice and equity.

3. Impact on Legal States:
Despite the legalization of adult-use cannabis in 24 states and the District of Columbia, many individuals continue to be criminalized for cannabis-related activities. Rescheduling to Schedule III should be accompanied by policies that reflect the reduced harm and changing public perception of cannabis. Prosecutors and sentencing judges should deprioritize cannabis-related charges and sentences, aligning with the substance’s new classification.

4. Probation and Parole Considerations:
The reclassification to Schedule III must be supported by amendments to existing policies to ensure that cannabis consumption, particularly for valid medical reasons, does not jeopardize an individual’s probationary or parole status. This will protect individuals who use cannabis medicinally from unjust legal repercussions.

5. Federal Mandates for Prosecutors:
In the absence of full descheduling, it is imperative that the current administration formalizes a mandate for federal prosecutors to view cannabis-related activities as lower priority offenses. This would align federal prosecution policies with the new classification and reduce the criminal justice burden on individuals involved in cannabis-related activities.

Conclusion:
Rescheduling cannabis to Schedule III is a positive step, but it is not sufficient on its own. Comprehensive measures, including descheduling, legalization, executive clemency, and policy amendments, are necessary to address the ongoing issues related to cannabis criminalization. I urge the DEA and the federal government to consider these points and take bold action towards a more just and equitable cannabis policy.

First, I'd like to share a bit of my story and experience with cannabis. 
In the 90s, I was a hard-working single mom. I was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis in the late 90s, then had to have a lumbar fusion in 2005. I've been physically disabled since then and haven't known a day without pain. I fell into a deep depression from the pain, the loss of my normal life, but mostly because I couldn't be the same mother to my 2 daughters. I was given opioid pain medicine, several different psychiatric medicines, a therapist, and was basically told to manage the best I could. Unable to work, I sold everything off value, except my van. My youngest daughter has type 1 diabetes, so I had to have transportation. By 2011, I was homeless and living in said van. In 2012, after a 6 year battle, I was awarded SSDI. I should have been thrilled, but the medications I took left me physically and mentally numb. Fast forward to 2019, at this time, I'm weaning off the psych and pain meds with the help of cannabis. Cannabis helps with my pain, depression, and anxiety so much better than pharmaceutical medication ever did. I'm living my life now instead of just existing day to day. I'm in college working towards a degree in Sociology. I'm more active with my family and friends. I'm in a much better place in my life thanks in big part to using cannabis to treat my health issues. This plant can and has saved lives. I firmly believe it should be legalized fully at the federal level and not just rescheduled. 

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether – thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states – I nonetheless do not oppose the factual basis underlying HHS’ recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower. It would be arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to reject HHS’s findings of fact and to maintain existing prohibitions of the cannabis plant.",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,0.699648897

This is an important and necessary step towards modernizing our nation's drug policies, reflecting current scientific understanding of cannabis' potential benefits and harms.

I am writing to register my opposition to the recommendation to move marijuana from Schedule 1 to Schedule 3 of the Controlled Substances Act. 

Rescheduling marijuana would allow the marijuana industry to begin deducting normal business expenses, including advertising and marketing expenses. This would make the industry enormously profitable and incentivize them to spend even more on advertising and marketing.  With this, we can expect marijuana sales to grow exponentially, and harms associated with marijuana use to rise in tandem. Big Tobacco taught us all too well the deleterious impact of advertising on youth: the more teens are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely they are to start smoking. The same will be true with marijuana. The marijuana industry will undoubtedly take a page out of Big Tobacco’s marketing playbook, making marijuana use look glamorous and benign with celebrity endorsements, candy flavoring (already seen in marijuana edibles), product placement in movies, and more. 

Perhaps most alarming: even without the expected deluge of ads and slick marketing, marijuana use is at an all-time high. Teen use of marijuana is at 30- year high, with more teens reporting smoking marijuana than tobacco. Among young adults 19 to 30, 26% used in the past month compared to 17% in 2011, and 11% were daily users, up from 6% in 2011. 

The recommendation from HHS failed to take into account actual/relative potential for abuse or harms associated with use. Contrary to popular narrative, marijuana can be addictive; In fact, as many as 1 in 3 past year marijuana users met the clinical criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder. People who self-medicate with marijuana are not exempt from becoming addicted to it. According to research at Massachusetts General Hospital, “using cannabis products to treat pain, anxiety and depression failed to improve these symptoms while doubling the risk of developing the addictive symptoms of cannabis use disorder.” 

With the exception of one study of medical marijuana patients in Maryland, the review from HHS failed to acknowledge or consider the link between marijuana and psychosis. This is especially concerning in light of the rising potency of marijuana. Daily users of marijuana over 10% THC are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than non-users. A 2023 study in Denmark determined that 30 percent of cases of schizophrenia among 21–30-year-old males could have been averted if cannabis use disorder had been prevented. A 2022 study found that hospital discharges for marijuana-associated psychosis were higher in states with legal marijuana, another precursor if those who push full-scale commercialization have their way. 

Marijuana use is especially concerning in young people, a factor HHS failed to adequately address. The National Center for Education Statistics said, “adolescent marijuana use has been associated with lower academic performance and a higher risk of dropping out of high school.”  Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, warns, “Youth who use marijuana regularly are more likely to have a hard time learning, problems remembering, and lower math and reading scores. These effects can last weeks after the last time they used marijuana.” Recognizing that much remains unknown about marijuana, NIDA noted, “researchers are still studying how long marijuana’s effects last and whether some changes may be permanent.” 

Finally, while some states recognize “medical marijuana” there is, in fact, no currently accepted medical use. Unlike other drugs in Schedule III, marijuana is not FDA approved to treat or cure any disease and it is not available for prescription in any state. In 2023, the American Medical Association adopted a position statement that “encourages hospitals and health systems to: (a) not recommend patient use of non-FDA approved cannabis or cannabis-derived products within healthcare facilities until such time as federal laws or regulations permit its use; and (b) educate medical staffs on cannabis use, effects and cannabis withdrawal syndrome.”

God/Mother Nature/Creation/The Universe in his/her/its infinite wisdom saw fit to include marijuana in the vast array of foliage spread across the globe. Then, along the way, humankind shows up, and a certain demography presumes to speak for all other humans by way of state sanction. And here we are...debating whether or not to go back to the freedom of personal choice existence blessed us with in the first place.

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

I am writing to express my strong support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. This is an important and necessary step towards modernizing our nation's drug policies, reflecting current scientific understanding of cannabis' potential benefits and harms.



For too long, marijuana has been categorized alongside highly dangerous substances like methamphetamine, despite mounting evidence suggesting its relative safety. Reclassifying it to Schedule III would not only acknowledge this reality but also pave the way for further research into its medicinal properties and potential risks.



Furthermore, reclassification would provide much-needed regulatory clarity for businesses operating within the burgeoning cannabis industry. The tax benefits that stand to accrue from such a move could stimulate economic growth and job creation in communities across America.



I urge you to consider these points as you review this critical proposal. Reclassifying marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act is a commonsense move that aligns with both public sentiment and scientific evidence. It represents another significant step forward in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy.



Thank you for your attention to this matter.

This is an important step toward a change in marijuana policy that addresses the decades-long discrimination against Black and Brown communities. 



Taking marijuana out of the same classification as more harmful substances like methamphetamine and heroin will give a huge boost to cannabis researchers and those in the cannabis business, and set the stage for further reparative measures for impacted communities.

DEA-2024-0059-34260,2024-07-19T04:00Z,Kelley Rico,"Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEA’s proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administration’s efforts to reconsider marijuana’s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it’s time to end this country’s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA’s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.  Marijuana is not a DRUG.  People who use this plant should not be in any way.  

Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients’ access to medical marijuana. 

Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won’t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.

The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or “descheduling.” Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. 

Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana’s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. 

Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.

Given the Biden Administration’s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.

President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden’s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,0.9990791228449944

Users and treatment providers alike.

I am writing to register my opposition to the recommendation to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. 

Rescheduling marijuana would allow the marijuana industry to deduct normal business expenses, including advertising and marketing expenses. This would make the industry profitable and incentivize them to spend even more on advertising and marketing.  This would likely cause marijuana sales and the harms associated with marijuana use to rise in tandem. Big Tobacco taught us the deleterious impact of advertising on youth: the more teens are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely they are to start smoking. The same will be true with marijuana. The marijuana industry will undoubtedly take a page out of Big Tobacco’s marketing playbook, making marijuana use look glamorous and benign with celebrity endorsements, candy flavoring (already seen in marijuana edibles), product placement in movies, and more. Even without the expected deluge of ads and marketing, marijuana use is at an all-time high. Teen use of marijuana is at 30- year high, with more teens reporting smoking marijuana than tobacco. Among young adults 19 to 30, 26% used in the past month compared to 17% in 2011, and 11% were daily users, up from 6% in 2011. 

HHS' recommendation failed to account for actual/relative potential for abuse or harms associated with use. Contrary to popular narrative, marijuana can be addictive. In fact, as many as 1 in 3 past year marijuana users met the clinical criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder. People who self-medicate with marijuana are not exempt from becoming addicted. According to research at Massachusetts General Hospital, “using cannabis products to treat pain, anxiety and depression failed to improve these symptoms while doubling the risk of developing the addictive symptoms of cannabis use disorder.” 

With the exception of one study of medical marijuana patients in Maryland, the review from HHS failed to acknowledge or consider the link between marijuana and psychosis. This is especially concerning in light of the rising potency of marijuana. Daily users of marijuana over 10% THC are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than non-users. A 2023 study in Denmark determined that 30% of cases of schizophrenia among 21–30-year-old males could have been averted if cannabis use disorder had been prevented. A 2022 study found that hospital discharges for marijuana-associated psychosis were higher in states with legal marijuana, another precursor if those who push full-scale commercialization have their way. 

Marijuana use is especially concerning in young people, a factor HHS failed to adequately address. The National Center for Education Statistics said, “adolescent marijuana use has been associated with lower academic performance and a higher risk of dropping out of high school.”  Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, warns, “Youth who use marijuana regularly are more likely to have a hard time learning, problems remembering, and lower math and reading scores. These effects can last weeks after the last time they used marijuana.” Recognizing that much remains unknown about marijuana, NIDA noted, “researchers are still studying how long marijuana’s effects last and whether some changes may be permanent.” 

Finally, while some states recognize “medical marijuana” there is no currently accepted medical use. Unlike other drugs in Schedule III, marijuana is not FDA approved to treat or cure any disease and it is not available for prescription in any state. In 2023, the American Medical Association adopted a position statement that “encourages hospitals and health systems to: (a) not recommend patient use of non-FDA approved cannabis or cannabis-derived products within healthcare facilities until such time as federal laws or regulations permit its use; and (b) educate medical staffs on cannabis use, effects and cannabis withdrawal syndrome.”

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

Personally, since I have become a medical patient in my state, I have stopped using alcohol. Alcohol has been a huge harm to myself, my family, and generations prior. I also do not use pain medications when prescribed. I also enjoy using cannabis to enhance my experiences as well. The fact that alcohol is deregulated and cannabis is not does not make much sense. 

In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether – thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states – I nonetheless do not oppose the factual basis underlying HHS’ recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower. It would be arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to reject HHS’s findings of fact and to maintain existing prohibitions of the cannabis plant.",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,0.9350838066423854

These effects can last weeks after the last time they used marijuana.” Recognizing that much remains unknown about marijuana, NIDA noted, “researchers are still studying how long marijuana’s effects last and whether some changes may be permanent.” 

Finally, while some states recognize “medical marijuana” there is no currently accepted medical use. Unlike other drugs in Schedule III, marijuana is not FDA approved to treat or cure any disease and it is not available for prescription in any state. In 2023, the American Medical Association adopted a position statement that “encourages hospitals and health systems to: (a) not recommend patient use of non-FDA approved cannabis or cannabis-derived products within healthcare facilities until such time as federal laws or regulations permit its use; and (b) educate medical staffs on cannabis use, effects and cannabis withdrawal syndrome.”

I am writing to express my strong support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. This is an important and necessary step towards modernizing our nation's drug policies, reflecting current scientific understanding of cannabis' potential benefits and harms.



For too long, marijuana has been categorized alongside highly dangerous substances like methamphetamine, despite mounting evidence suggesting its relative safety. Reclassifying it to Schedule III would not only acknowledge this reality but also pave the way for further research into its medicinal properties and potential risks.



Furthermore, reclassification would provide much-needed regulatory clarity for businesses operating within the burgeoning cannabis industry. The tax benefits that stand to accrue from such a move could stimulate economic growth and job creation in communities across America.



I urge you to consider these points as you review this critical proposal. Reclassifying marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act is a commonsense move that aligns with both public sentiment and scientific evidence. It represents another significant step forward in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy.

As a member of the state-legal cannabis industry, I believe this change is a critical and long-overdue acknowledgment of the medical value of cannabis. This aligns with the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) recent recommendation to reclassify cannabis to Schedule III. However, rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and cannabinoid products should be properly regulated under a new federal regulatory pathway.

I am

Cannabis has had a broadly accepted medical value within the scientific community and to millions of Americans who use it under their physician's care and obtain it legally through state programs that exist in the vast majority of U.S. states. Additionally, the abuse potential of cannabis does not warrant its classification as a Schedule I substance, as it is far safer than legal products like alcohol and tobacco, by every possible measure. 

Reclassifying cannabis to Schedule III not only aligns federal law with current scientific understanding but also facilitates further research by removing some of the barriers associated with Schedule I classification. This step is essential in advancing medical science and expanding access to much-needed therapeutic options.

While the reclassification to Schedule III is a significant and positive step, it is important to recognize that it is only the beginning. The ultimate goal should be to treat intoxicating cannabis products in a manner similar to alcohol, with regulated legal sales for adults. 

Most Americans already live in a state that has made cannabis legal for adults and the only way to harmonize federal law with those states is to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act.  Doing so would not only provide consistency across states,  it would eliminate the illicit market and allow for the imposition of reasonable federal regulations to protect public health and safety.

In conclusion, reclassifying cannabis to Schedule III is a positive first step that acknowledges its medical value, supports state-regulated programs, and promotes public health and safety. While it is not the final goal, it sets the stage for future reforms that will ultimately lead to a legal and regulated cannabis market. I urge the Department of Justice and Drug Enforcement Administration to move forward with this reclassification and to work with other federal agencies to establish clear enforcement guidelines that respect state laws and support the cannabis industry.

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether – thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states – I nonetheless do not oppose the factual basis underlying HHS’ recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower.

I am writing to you regarding the proposed rulemaking by the Department of Justice to transfer marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), as published on May 20, 2024. While I appreciate the efforts to recognize the medical use of marijuana and its potential for abuse relative to substances in Schedules I and II, I believe that full legalization is a more appropriate course of action.

The current proposal acknowledges the accepted medical use of marijuana and its lower potential for abuse compared to other controlled substances. However, maintaining marijuana as a Schedule III substance still imposes unnecessary barriers to its access and research. Full legalization would align federal policy with the growing consensus among states that have already recognized the therapeutic benefits of cannabis and have established their own regulatory frameworks.

Moreover, the continued criminalization of marijuana disproportionately affects marginalized communities, contributing to social and racial injustices. Full legalization would help rectify these disparities and allow for the expungement of records for those previously convicted of non-violent cannabis offenses.

I urge the DEA to consider the broader implications of marijuana scheduling and to take bold steps towards full legalization. This would not only reflect the current scientific understanding and public opinion but also promote social equity, economic growth, and public health.

But rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, as the Department of Health & Human Services and the DEA have proposed, is insufficient. If cannabis remains on the CSA, people can continue to face penalties at the federal level for possession, including arrest and incarceration, which lead to a lifetime of consequences that impact someone’s ability to secure employment, housing, public benefits, educational opportunities, and more.

I am 70 years old and I’ve been prescribed Cannabis for help with anxiety and insomnia. This drug has been a great help to me and doesn’t have the side effects I’ve noticed with other prescribed medication. I wouldn’t want to be without it! However, it’s very difficult to get reliable information about its effect on health especially on cardiovascular health. There are some studies indication that it may be harmful if overused but these are statistical, not double-blind long-term studies of actual individuals. So far, we know nothing about how the method of administration, smoking, tincture, edible etc., affects health. It’s also not clear to what extent dosage matters and no one has considered other life-style variables such as diet and exercise in reaching these conclusions. 

   For these reasons, it’s vital that Cannabis be moved from the Schedule One category so that proper studies can be conducted. Until then, many vulnerable people, such as elderly people, will be subjected to unnecessary risk.

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether – thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states – I nonetheless do not oppose the factual basis underlying HHS’ recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower.

I am writing to register my opposition to the recommendation to move marijuana from Schedule 1 to Schedule 3 of the Controlled Substances Act. 

Rescheduling marijuana would allow the marijuana industry to begin deducting normal business expenses, including advertising and marketing expenses. This would make the industry enormously profitable and incentivize them to spend even more on advertising and marketing.  With this, we can expect marijuana sales to grow exponentially, and harms associated with marijuana use to rise in tandem. Big Tobacco taught us all too well the deleterious impact of advertising on youth: the more teens are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely they are to start smoking. The same will be true with marijuana. The marijuana industry will undoubtedly take a page out of Big Tobacco’s marketing playbook, making marijuana use look glamorous and benign with celebrity endorsements, candy flavoring (already seen in marijuana edibles), product placement in movies, and more. 

Perhaps most alarming: even without the expected deluge of ads and slick marketing, marijuana use is at an all-time high. Teen use of marijuana is at 30- year high, with more teens reporting smoking marijuana than tobacco. Among young adults 19 to 30, 26% used in the past month compared to 17% in 2011, and 11% were daily users, up from 6% in 2011. 

The recommendation from HHS failed to take into account actual/relative potential for abuse or harms associated with use. Contrary to popular narrative, marijuana can be addictive; In fact, as many as 1 in 3 past year marijuana users met the clinical criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder. People who self-medicate with marijuana are not exempt from becoming addicted to it. According to research at Massachusetts General Hospital, “using cannabis products to treat pain, anxiety and depression failed to improve these symptoms while doubling the risk of developing the addictive symptoms of cannabis use disorder.” 

With the exception of one study of medical marijuana patients in Maryland, the review from HHS failed to acknowledge or consider the link between marijuana and psychosis. This is especially concerning in light of the rising potency of marijuana. Daily users of marijuana over 10% THC are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than non-users. A 2023 study in Denmark determined that 30 percent of cases of schizophrenia among 21–30-year-old males could have been averted if cannabis use disorder had been prevented. A 2022 study found that hospital discharges for marijuana-associated psychosis were higher in states with legal marijuana, another precursor if those who push full-scale commercialization have their way. 

Marijuana use is especially concerning in young people, a factor HHS failed to adequately address. The National Center for Education Statistics said, “adolescent marijuana use has been associated with lower academic performance and a higher risk of dropping out of high school.”  Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, warns, “Youth who use marijuana regularly are more likely to have a hard time learning, problems remembering, and lower math and reading scores. These effects can last weeks after the last time they used marijuana.” Recognizing that much remains unknown about marijuana, NIDA noted, “researchers are still studying how long marijuana’s effects last and whether some changes may be permanent.” 

Finally, while some states recognize “medical marijuana” there is, in fact, no currently accepted medical use. Unlike other drugs in Schedule III, marijuana is not FDA approved to treat or cure any disease and it is not available for prescription in any state. In 2023, the American Medical Association adopted a position statement that “encourages hospitals and health systems to: (a) not recommend patient use of non-FDA approved cannabis or cannabis-derived products within healthcare facilities until such time as federal laws or regulations permit its use; and (b) educate medical staffs on cannabis use, effects and cannabis withdrawal syndrome.”

Frankly, I believe it should not be scheduled at all, leaving it for regulation like we already do for alcohol and tobacco. American adults are left to decide for themselves on how they do or do not want to consume alcoholic beverages and tobacco products like cigars, cigarettes and chewing tobacco - both of which are known to cause a high number of casualties annually. To tell Americans that we're not able to make similar decisions as it pertains to the consumption of cannabis is demeaning. Over the past several years, I have seen first-hand how my friends and family have benefit from the medical program enacted in my home state of Florida. Keeping marijuana/cannabis as a scheduled substance unfairly punishes those who would seek alternatives to conventional medicine by depriving them of their second amendment rights in exchange for something recommended to them by a physician that may help them live a healthier life, free of opioids and the risk of addiction that comes with them. The states that have enacted medical use or that have legalized entirely have seen the benefits of this movement first-hand, and well over half of the United States have some form of cannabis allowed for use by their citizens. It is long past-due to get the rest of the nation, and the federal government in sync on this matter.

At the very least, marijuana/cannabis should be moved to Schedule 3 to clear the way for all manners of research into its therapeutic benefits. Ideally, it should be descheduled entirely, leaving the American people to decide for themselves if they want to use it or not. Our neighbors to the north have already taken the route of full legalization and they've not had anything close to what the doomsayers in our country are constantly repeating as potential issues with legalizing this plant.

I don't expect an answer to this question, but why not place this on the ballots for the upcoming election and let the American people vote on this directly? This may be a naive comment from someone not well-versed in politics, but seriously. We can vote on who is going to run our local and national government - I think we can handle voting on whether or not to deschedule cannabis - a plant native to this country.

At a minimum, please follow the science and side with the recommended rescheduling of cannabis/marijuana. Please also consider descheduling it entirely, giving Americans the ability to make their own choices as it pertains to cannabis/marijuana.

As a member of the state-legal cannabis industry, I believe this change is a critical and long-overdue acknowledgment of the medical value of cannabis. This aligns with the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) recent recommendation to reclassify cannabis to Schedule III. However, rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough- marijuana must be decriminalized to protect consumers, workers, small businesses, and ultimately public health and safety. Marijuana must be federally descheduled at the earliest opportunity and completely removed from the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and cannabinoid products should be properly regulated under a new federal regulatory pathway.

It's time to completely remove it, as cannabis does so much to help medical and normal day to day stress. we the people should be able to decide what's right and wrong. we also need it to be federal legal thank you

Cannabis has had a broadly accepted medical value within the scientific community and to millions of Americans who use it under their physician's care and obtain it legally through state programs that exist in the vast majority of U.S. states. Additionally, the abuse potential of cannabis does not warrant its classification as a Schedule I substance, as it is far safer than legal products like alcohol and tobacco, by every possible measure. 

Reclassifying cannabis to Schedule III not only aligns federal law with current scientific understanding but also facilitates further research by removing some of the barriers associated with Schedule I classification. This step is essential in advancing medical science and expanding access to much-needed therapeutic options.

While the reclassification to Schedule III is a significant and positive step, it is important to recognize that it is only the beginning. The ultimate goal should be to treat intoxicating cannabis products in a manner similar to alcohol, with regulated legal sales for adults. 

Most Americans already live in a state that has made cannabis legal for adults and the only way to harmonize federal law with those states is to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act.  Doing so would not only provide consistency across states,  it would eliminate the illicit market and allow for the imposition of reasonable federal regulations to protect public health and safety.

In conclusion, reclassifying cannabis to Schedule III is a positive first step that acknowledges its medical value, supports state-regulated programs, and promotes public health and safety. While it is not the final goal, it sets the stage for future reforms that will ultimately lead to a legal and regulated cannabis market. I urge the Department of Justice and Drug Enforcement Administration to move forward with this reclassification and to work with other federal agencies to establish clear enforcement guidelines that respect state laws and support the cannabis industry.

DEA-2024-0059-15262,2024-06-11T04:00Z,Frank Miller,"To Whom it May Concern:

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

my backwards state, indiana, doesn't even have legal medical cannibas so it is going to take a federal rescheduling for them to get with it.

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.


HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether – thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states – I nonetheless do not oppose the factual basis underlying HHS’ recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower. It would be arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to reject HHS’s findings of fact and to maintain existing prohibitions of the cannabis plant.",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,1.000000000000001

We need a broad federal expungement policy - no one should be incarcerated, anywhere in the country, for cannabis possession alone, when millions of people are now consuming it freely. Imagine if there were thousands of people currently incarcerated for possessing alcohol! A recent study shows that in fact, daily cannabis use is outpacing daily alcohol use for the first time (source: AP News), and yet these two substances are treated so radically differently by the criminal justice system. Biden's administration can and should do much more to extend clemency and expungement to those folks unjustly incarcerated for cannabis possession, not just at the federal level, but by incentivizing action at the state level as well.

That said, when it comes to rescheduling cannabis for research purposes (please note that marijuana is a dated term with a deeply racialized history), this cannot happen soon enough. As I mentioned, daily cannabis use is outpacing daily alcohol use in this country, and as a former daily user, I believe there are profound pros and cons to this trend. There must be robust, comprehensive, longitudinal research done on cannabis and the brain, the endocrine system, etc. There must be limits placed on the allowable potency of cannabis products, and increased public awareness of the comparative risks of different types of cannabis products (for example, while a typical joint contains 20-30% THC, the popular, discreet ""vape pens"" contain upwards of 80% THC, making them particularly potent and addictive). While cannabis is a powerfully useful and positive medicine and recreational substance for many, when used moderately, it also carries profound potential for addiction and long-term health risks, particularly for young people with still-developing brains. One need only peruse the many Reddit forums of people trying to quit cannabis to understand the power of its impacts on the body. Again, I believe strongly that cannabis should be rescheduled if not descheduled entirely, not because it is an entirely risk-free substance but because a) there are many decriminalized substances that nonetheless carry great health risks, and b) cannabis is unique in its capacity to both help and harm, and it's therefore necessary to approach the drug with thoughtful, nuanced, bias-free discernment, research, and policy. I have experienced both the positives and the negatives of cannabis in my own life and feel strongly that this moment is an inflection point in cannabis legislation.

I am writing to express my strong support for the complete removal of cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) schedules. The current classification of cannabis as a Schedule I substance is both outdated and scientifically unfounded. I urge the DEA to consider the overwhelming evidence supporting the medicinal benefits of cannabis, as well as the societal and economic benefits of regulating it similarly to alcohol.

1.	⁠Medical Benefits: Cannabis has been shown to provide relief for a variety of medical conditions, including chronic pain, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and anxiety. Numerous studies have demonstrated its efficacy in reducing symptoms and improving the quality of life for patients who do not respond well to traditional pharmaceuticals. By keeping cannabis on the schedule list, we are denying patients access to a treatment that could significantly improve their lives.
2.	⁠Economic Benefits: The regulation of cannabis similar to alcohol could provide substantial economic benefits. States that have legalized cannabis have seen significant increases in tax revenue, job creation, and economic growth. These funds can be used to support public services, infrastructure, and education, benefiting the community as a whole.
3.	⁠Social Justice: The criminalization of cannabis has disproportionately affected minority communities, leading to a cycle of incarceration and disenfranchisement. By removing cannabis from the schedule list and regulating it, we can begin to address the injustices of the past and create a fairer legal system.
4.	⁠Public Safety: Regulating cannabis like alcohol would allow for better quality control and safety standards. This would reduce the risks associated with black-market cannabis, including contamination and inconsistent potency. Legal, regulated markets ensure that consumers have access to safe, tested products.
5.	⁠International Trends: Many countries around the world are moving towards decriminalization and regulation of cannabis. The United States should follow suit to remain a leader in progressive drug policy and to harmonize with international standards.

In conclusion, the rescheduling of cannabis is a step in the right direction, but it does not go far enough. Cannabis should be completely removed from the schedule list and regulated similarly to alcohol. This approach will ensure that we maximize the medical, economic, and social benefits of cannabis, while also addressing issues of public safety and social justice.",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,0.3197116634254488

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

I am permanently disabled. I have had three cervical spine surgeries in which has left me in pain 24/7 due to spinal damage. My spine did not heal. I have to take morphine and muscle relaxers every day and am still in pain. In desperation, I tried marijuana. It helped me more than my prescriptions have.

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal.

Below is a pre typed that I agree with but also want to put in my own two cents.
I didn’t smoke cannabis until it became legal in my state. Always said didn’t see issue with it but wouldn’t touch it u til legal (plus didn’t trust getting it off random ppl). Anyway I have a bunch of health problems so wasn’t any problem to get approved. I only smoke it when I need it (ex: when can’t sleep (insomnia) when pain in my dead leg get extremely bad and the nerve meds ain’t helping or if having a bad anxiety attack (oddly it calms me but can only smoke indica)). This has helped me a lot and I feel it should absolutely be legalized at the very least medically legal. After trying it I have to say drink is way way worse. Plus havnt seen any down sides (except for price of buying it at dispensary) no cravings not addicting or side effects with my medication. Personally I would say it should be handled the same as alcohol in my opinion. The rest is the pre written part that I’m sure you’ve seen tons of just wanted to give my views from first hand experience from last couple years
I am providing comments in support of the reclassification of botanical cannabis (Docket No. DEA–1362).

Five of the senators (Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Bernie Sanders, Kristen Gillibrand, and Ron Wyden) wrote to the Attorney General, President Joe Biden, and HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra in July 2022, urging cannabis descheduling and pardons for those convicted of non-violent cannabis-related offenses. Letter to President Joseph Biden, et al. from Senator Elizabeth Warren, et al. (July 6, 2022).  The senators “write to urge” DEA to “swiftly deschedule marijuana” and, while rescheduling to schedule III “would mark a significant step forward, it would not resolve the worst harms of the current system” for marijuana as a controlled substance, which “has had a devastating impact on our communities and is increasingly out of step with state law and public opinion.” Letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland and Administrator Anne Milgram, from Elizabeth Warren, et al. (January 29, 2024).  They note that, descheduled, marijuana could still be subject to public health regulations.
Marijuana as a schedule I substance is in the same schedule as heroin and in a more dangerous schedule than fentanyl or cocaine, even though it is consistently found to be less dangerous than those substances, and less dangerous than alcohol.
HHS’ recommendation noted that marijuana “does not produce serious outcomes compared to drugs in Schedules I or II” and “the vast majority of individuals who use marijuana are doing so in a manner that does not lead to dangerous outcomes to themselves or others.”
To support its 2016 rescheduling denials, DEA pointed to lack of scientific evidence supporting medical use of marijuana, which created a catch-22 because, as a schedule I substance, marijuana is subject to DEA’s arduous research approval process and restrictions on federal research funding, stymieing researchers’ ability to rigorously study its medical uses.
Today, experts generally agree that marijuana has currently accepted medical uses for several indications, including managing pain, spasms, and nausea in patients undergoing chemotherapy and stimulating appetite in patients with weight loss from AIDS.Thousands of doctors in the 38 states that permit the medical use of cannabis recommend marijuana to their patients and millions of patients consume medical marijuana under healthcare professionals’ guidance each year.
The relevant international treaties respect the legal frameworks of signatories and allow for sufficient flexibility for states parties to design and implement national drug policies in light of their priorities and needs.
HHS’ recommendation analysis could support descheduling, particularly as marijuana has less adverse outcomes, including less potential for an overdose, and less abuse potential than non-scheduled substances like alcohol or those scheduled lower than schedule III like benzodiazepines.
Many criminal penalties for marijuana will continue as long as marijuana remains federally controlled because those penalties are based on the quantity of marijuana involved, not the drug’s schedule status.
Without descheduling marijuana, “criminal penalties (including prison sentences, fines, and asset forfeiture) for recreational marijuana use, and for medical use of marijuana products that lack federal approval, would still exist, disproportionately penalizing Black and Brown communities.”

DEA-2024-0059-11041,2024-06-05T04:00Z,Chris Vatis,"Concentrated Weed has developed into a major problem. It is inducing psychosis and wreaking havoc on lives. ER visits from psychosis induced marijuana is skyrocketing 
and the data on long term effects is nonexistent. This psychosis is requiring inpatient treatment to keep both the smoker and general public safe and there are not enough treatment facilities with this expertise.
Please do not make it easier to procure concentrated high THC marijuana. The easy availability is causing severe mental health problems especially to young adults.

I am writing to register my opposition to the recommendation to move marijuana from Schedule 1 to Schedule 3 of the Controlled Substances Act. 

Rescheduling marijuana would allow the marijuana industry to begin deducting normal business expenses, including advertising and marketing expenses. This would make the industry enormously profitable and incentivize them to spend even more on advertising and marketing.  With this, we can expect marijuana sales to grow exponentially, and harms associated with marijuana use to rise in tandem. Big Tobacco taught us all too well the deleterious impact of advertising on youth: the more teens are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely they are to start smoking. The same will be true with marijuana. The marijuana industry will undoubtedly take a page out of Big Tobacco’s marketing playbook, making marijuana use look glamorous and benign with celebrity endorsements, candy flavoring (already seen in marijuana edibles), product placement in movies, and more. 

Perhaps most alarming: even without the expected deluge of ads and slick marketing, marijuana use is at an all-time high. Teen use of marijuana is at 30- year high, with more teens reporting smoking marijuana than tobacco. Among young adults 19 to 30, 26% used in the past month compared to 17% in 2011, and 11% were daily users, up from 6% in 2011. 

The recommendation from HHS failed to take into account actual/relative potential for abuse or harms associated with use. Contrary to popular narrative, marijuana can be addictive; In fact, as many as 1 in 3 past year marijuana users met the clinical criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder. People who self-medicate with marijuana are not exempt from becoming addicted to it. According to research at Massachusetts General Hospital, “using cannabis products to treat pain, anxiety and depression failed to improve these symptoms while doubling the risk of developing the addictive symptoms of cannabis use disorder.” 

With the exception of one study of medical marijuana patients in Maryland, the review from HHS failed to acknowledge or consider the link between marijuana and psychosis. This is especially concerning in light of the rising potency of marijuana. Daily users of marijuana over 10% THC are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than non-users. A 2023 study in Denmark determined that 30 percent of cases of schizophrenia among 21–30-year-old males could have been averted if cannabis use disorder had been prevented. A 2022 study found that hospital discharges for marijuana-associated psychosis were higher in states with legal marijuana, another precursor if those who push full-scale commercialization have their way. 

Marijuana use is especially concerning in young people, a factor HHS failed to adequately address. The National Center for Education Statistics said, “adolescent marijuana use has been associated with lower academic performance and a higher risk of dropping out of high school.”  Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, warns, “Youth who use marijuana regularly are more likely to have a hard time learning, problems remembering, and lower math and reading scores. These effects can last weeks after the last time they used marijuana.” Recognizing that much remains unknown about marijuana, NIDA noted, “researchers are still studying how long marijuana’s effects last and whether some changes may be permanent.” 

Finally, while some states recognize “medical marijuana” there is, in fact, no currently accepted medical use. Unlike other drugs in Schedule III, marijuana is not FDA approved to treat or cure any disease and it is not available for prescription in any state. In 2023, the American Medical Association adopted a position statement that “encourages hospitals and health systems to: (a) not recommend patient use of non-FDA approved cannabis or cannabis-derived products within healthcare facilities until such time as federal laws or regulations permit its use; and (b) educate medical staffs on cannabis use, effects and cannabis withdrawal syndrome.” 

I encourage you to follow the science and public health evidence on this issue and keep marijuana in Schedule I.",Opposed,0.942660258989778

I am writing in support of total descheduling of marijuana altogether.  It should not be on any of the DEA's schedules.   Cannabis, which is not a drug, (it's an herb) and has a far lower potential for abuse than any actual narcotic drugs, such as barbiturates or opiates. It has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled at all. 

Note that Germany recently altogether removed marijuana from their list of narcotics, which indicates it has been erroneously classified as a ""narcotic"" drug for decades. It's not a narcotic, it's a harmless herb.

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.”   Cannabis is not a pain killer, but it helps activate the human body's built-in pain killing mechanism which is called, ""the endorphin system"".

As an herbal alternative to narcotic drugs, cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. While no one dies from cannabis use, more than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning.  I am not aware of any deaths caused by the herb cannabis.

Humanity has been aware of herbal cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

It should be descheduled, since it has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

I am writing to express my support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. 



This is an important step toward a change in marijuana policy that addresses the decades-long discrimination against Black and Brown communities. 



Taking marijuana out of the same classification as more harmful substances like methamphetamine and heroin will give a huge boost to cannabis researchers and those in the cannabis business, and set the stage for further reparative measures for impacted communities.

This is an important and necessary step towards modernizing our nation's drug policies, reflecting current scientific understanding of cannabis' potential benefits and harms.



For too long, marijuana has been categorized alongside highly dangerous substances like methamphetamine, despite mounting evidence suggesting its relative safety. Reclassifying it to Schedule III would not only acknowledge this reality but also pave the way for further research into its medicinal properties and potential risks.



Furthermore, reclassification would provide much-needed regulatory clarity for businesses operating within the burgeoning cannabis industry. The tax benefits that stand to accrue from such a move could stimulate economic growth and job creation in communities across America.



I urge you to consider these points as you review this critical proposal. Reclassifying marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act is a commonsense move that aligns with both public sentiment and scientific evidence.

DEA-2024-0059-5500,2024-05-26T04:00Z,Derek Benedict,"Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEA’s proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).

While I appreciate the Biden Administration’s efforts to reconsider marijuana’s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling.

Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it’s time to end this country’s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA’s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.

Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients’ access to medical marijuana. 

Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won’t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.

The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or “descheduling.” Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. 

Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana’s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. 

Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.

Given the Biden Administration’s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.

President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden’s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,0.9995468393694412

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.

DEA-2024-0059-40810,2024-07-23T04:00Z,Anonymous,"I am providing comments in support of the reclassification of botanical cannabis (Docket No. DEA–1362).

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered safely under medical supervision. 

Speaking to my own experience with cannabis, I found it to be extremely helpful for post-surgical pain and recovery after a major abdominal operation some years ago. I was in constant pain, both a ""deep"" interior pain (likely from internal trauma) and a more ""surface level"" pain (from the staples holding my skin together and my healing skin). I was prescribed the opiate Vicodin for the pain, which gave me wide mood swings and dulled my consciousness to the point that I was not able to function normally in work environments and could barely stay awake during the day. Worse, it didn't truly alleviate the pain, it simply dulled my brain to the point that the pain wasn't as sharp or potent (but I could still feel it). By using cannabis, I was able to finally quiet the pain and irritation of my healing skin — and I was much better able to cope with the deep ""interior"" discomfort — without becoming a vacant shell of my usual self. In fact, I didn't even feel ""high"" after smoking, I simply felt ""normal."" 

Further, a known side effect of the operation I received (a bowel resectioning) is lack of appetite because the re-coupled GI tract is ""shocked"" out of peristalsis, the natural internal ""pulse"" that moves food and waste through the body. I felt no hunger days after the operation — yet it was imperative that I eat in order to nourish myself, heal, and ""re-start"" the GI process. Smoking cannabis ignited real hunger in me (sometimes called ""the munchies"" but in this case I'd call it ""a medically relevant hunger response"") and made me desire food in a way that I simply couldn't while I was on the opiates, which dulled my desire to eat. 

Instead of taking addictive opiates that made me irrational, angry, dull of mind and absolutely hunger-free, I inhaled a real medicine that made me healthily hungry, alleviated my pain on multiple levels, and left me feeling alert and ""normal."" I can say without reservation that cannabis was a key factor in my post-surgery healing process, one that further enabled me to participate in rehabilitative exercise and productive work without any negative side effects. 

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated 6M patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30K healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the CDC. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines (a Schedule IV drug) or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether—thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states—I nonetheless do not oppose the factual basis underlying HHS’ recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower. It would be arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to reject HHS’s findings of fact and to maintain existing prohibitions of the cannabis plant.",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,0.5556175043081965

I want it to be clear that there is a known and recorded history related to the prohibition of cannabis and it's connection to the federal government trying to silence civil rights activists, ""leftists"", ""hippies"" and various American citizens of color. The people that engineered this initiative are long gone, yet the legislation has not been updated to reflect what we know about the facts of the situation. We have citizens that are world renowned that are long time cannabis users, from scientists like Carl Sagan to artists like Willie Nelson. Many of our European allies have done extensive research into both recreational cannabis and medicinal use of tetrahydrocannibonol, and somehow the world keeps spinning. To keep up this charade based on racist propaganda does nothing for us besides embarrass us on the global stage. We need things to reflect reality and utilize the hard work scientists of all sorts have put into studying this plant and the compounds found within.

With the mountain of data that has come out over the years it has become apparent that marijuana poses a far lower risk than current alternative such as alcohol and tobacco products. The regulation of marijuana should be governed like these substances. It should be kept out of the hands of minors but should not be restricted from responsible consenting adults. The prohibition of marijuana has long been a politicized issue that has been wielded as a weapon to go after marginalized groups and has been demonized unjustly. While a shift of this magnitude should not be taken lightly. It is time to take a step away from prohibitionary tactics of the past and move into a new age. Instead of demonizing a substance that has been shown to have far fewer harmful negative effects as many other far less regulated substances, we must now shift towards properly educating our future generations responsible consumption and use. Marijuana legalization has the support of the majority of the country and has already had a significant presence through the state laws that have been passed, things must now transition on a federal level.

This is an important and necessary step towards modernizing our nation's drug policies, reflecting current scientific understanding of cannabis' potential benefits and harms.



For too long, marijuana has been categorized alongside highly dangerous substances like methamphetamine, despite mounting evidence suggesting its relative safety. Reclassifying it to Schedule III would not only acknowledge this reality but also pave the way for further research into its medicinal properties and potential risks.



Furthermore, reclassification would provide much-needed regulatory clarity for businesses operating within the burgeoning cannabis industry. The tax benefits that stand to accrue from such a move could stimulate economic growth and job creation in communities across America.



I urge you to consider these points as you review this critical proposal. Reclassifying marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act is a commonsense move that aligns with both public sentiment and scientific evidence. It represents another significant step forward in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy.

In my own experience I was hit with a serious bout of pneumonia in 2016 and it attacked my pancreas and left me with diabetes  2 unfairly as I always ate healthy and controlled. When I awoke in the hospital from the diabetic coma it put me I had lost all sensation in my hands and all I could feel was pain of burning and needles 24/7 in my hands. I would wake at night and slam my hands into the walls to feel anything other than burning and pain and numbness. I talked to many doctors and they couldnt find a way to help me as I dont take pills unless absolutely necessary and all they could offer were heavy pain pills and I said ""No"" to those options as I have many friends and family members who were given ""Good Ol Pain pills"" and it created monsters in many if not all of them over time. So eventually one of my doctors recommended that I try medical cannabis to ease my anger and daily pain that was causing me the endless anger. So having nothing to lose since my state (Connecticut) was great enough to legalize cannabis medical first and then recreational I tried it and with every next new day my quality of life got better and better. The pain was much more bearable and tolerable after I would smoke the cannabis and it didnt stop me from being active and doing all the things I did before I tried cannabis if anything it enriched my daily life in ways that I hadnt expected or anticipated. It SAVED my life as I was having bad thoughts and wanted to not be here on the planet anymore during the daily bouts of pain prior to my trial of use of cannabis. Since my usage I havent had not one bad day and every day all I see is opportunity to be a more productive person and happy in my life. 
CANNABIS was a True Blessing to me. I am so grateful for the doctors who helped me both during and after my health collapse and very lucky that one of those doctors gave me the insight to trying cannabis and seeing if it was right for me and it really was. 

I am living proof that it works and has a positive effect.

Cannabis has had a broadly accepted medical value within the scientific community and to millions of Americans who use it under their physician's care and obtain it legally through state programs that exist in the vast majority of U.S. states. Additionally, the abuse potential of cannabis does not warrant its classification as a Schedule I substance, as it is far safer than legal products like alcohol and tobacco, by every possible measure. 

Reclassifying cannabis to Schedule III not only aligns federal law with current scientific understanding but also facilitates further research by removing some of the barriers associated with Schedule I classification. This step is essential in advancing medical science and expanding access to much-needed therapeutic options.

While the reclassification to Schedule III is a significant and positive step, it is important to recognize that it is only the beginning. The ultimate goal should be to treat intoxicating cannabis products in a manner similar to alcohol, with regulated legal sales for adults. 

Most Americans already live in a state that has made cannabis legal for adults and the only way to harmonize federal law with those states is to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act.  Doing so would not only provide consistency across states,  it would eliminate the illicit market and allow for the imposition of reasonable federal regulations to protect public health and safety.

In conclusion, reclassifying cannabis to Schedule III is a positive first step that acknowledges its medical value, supports state-regulated programs, and promotes public health and safety. While it is not the final goal, it sets the stage for future reforms that will ultimately lead to a legal and regulated cannabis market. I urge the Department of Justice and Drug Enforcement Administration to move forward with this reclassification and to work with other federal agencies to establish clear enforcement guidelines that respect state laws and support the cannabis industry.

Journalist Dan Baum’s April cover story for Harper’s magazine describes a 1994 interview with Nixon advisor, John Ehrlichman, in which Ehrlichman makes the following admission: 

“You want to know what this was really all about?” he asked with the bluntness of a man who, after public disgrace and a stretch in federal prison, had little left to protect. “The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”"" 

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA.

DEA-2024-0059-27607,2024-07-08T04:00Z,M K,"The DEA’s proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) must change dramatically in order to positively effect social change, surrounding marijuana. While I appreciate the Biden Administration’s efforts to reconsider marijuana’s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it’s time to end this country’s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA’s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.

Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients’ access to medical marijuana. 

Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won’t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.

The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or “descheduling.” Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. 

Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana’s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. 

Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.

Given the Biden Administration’s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.

President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden’s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,0.990985200690258

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

I suffered from debilitating migraines for most of my childhood and into adulthood that resulted in missed school and work, losses of opportunities, and left me with depression. Cannabis has helped me to control migraines, pain, and depression better than any pharmaceutical has been able to. Yet now I face being fired for consuming medicine that helps me if my employer tests me. I face criminal punishment if I am caught I possession of this medicine. Do the right thing and delist cannabis.

In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether – thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states – I nonetheless do not oppose the factual basis underlying HHS’ recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower. It would be arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to reject HHS’s findings of fact and to maintain existing prohibitions of the cannabis plant.

DEA-2024-0059-7054,2024-05-29T04:00Z,Claudia Wright,"To Whom it May Concern:

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.

DEA-2024-0059-28781,2024-07-11T04:00Z,Kimberly Hartke,"I worked for two parent -led organizations for over a decade, and monitored the worst outcomes of legalization. By far, marijuana is the worst scourge on society, causing violent crime, marital discord, teen suicides, job loss and workplace accidents. 

This is the worst idea fueled by drug addicted individuals who would like their bad habit legitimized and commercialized. i have never seen such greed and corruption. This is not a normal industry, It is a VICE and causes serious societal deterioration and many personal tragedies. The mental health harms are alarming and it is the most addictive drug, worse than alcohol and harder drugs.

I am writing to register my opposition to the recommendation to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. 

Rescheduling marijuana would allow the marijuana industry to deduct normal business expenses, including advertising and marketing expenses. This would make the industry profitable and incentivize them to spend even more on advertising and marketing.  This would likely cause marijuana sales and the harms associated with marijuana use to rise in tandem. Big Tobacco taught us the deleterious impact of advertising on youth: the more teens are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely they are to start smoking. The same will be true with marijuana. The marijuana industry will undoubtedly take a page out of Big Tobacco’s marketing playbook, making marijuana use look glamorous and benign with celebrity endorsements, candy flavoring (already seen in marijuana edibles), product placement in movies, and more. Even without the expected deluge of ads and marketing, marijuana use is at an all-time high. Teen use of marijuana is at 30- year high, with more teens reporting smoking marijuana than tobacco. Among young adults 19 to 30, 26% used in the past month compared to 17% in 2011, and 11% were daily users, up from 6% in 2011. 

HHS' recommendation failed to account for actual/relative potential for abuse or harms associated with use. Contrary to popular narrative, marijuana can be addictive. In fact, as many as 1 in 3 past year marijuana users met the clinical criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder. People who self-medicate with marijuana are not exempt from becoming addicted. According to research at Massachusetts General Hospital, “using cannabis products to treat pain, anxiety and depression failed to improve these symptoms while doubling the risk of developing the addictive symptoms of cannabis use disorder.” 

With the exception of one study of medical marijuana patients in Maryland, the review from HHS failed to acknowledge or consider the link between marijuana and psychosis. This is especially concerning in light of the rising potency of marijuana. Daily users of marijuana over 10% THC are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than non-users. A 2023 study in Denmark determined that 30% of cases of schizophrenia among 21–30-year-old males could have been averted if cannabis use disorder had been prevented. A 2022 study found that hospital discharges for marijuana-associated psychosis were higher in states with legal marijuana, another precursor if those who push full-scale commercialization have their way. 

Marijuana use is especially concerning in young people, a factor HHS failed to adequately address. The National Center for Education Statistics said, “adolescent marijuana use has been associated with lower academic performance and a higher risk of dropping out of high school.”  Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, warns, “Youth who use marijuana regularly are more likely to have a hard time learning, problems remembering, and lower math and reading scores. These effects can last weeks after the last time they used marijuana.” Recognizing that much remains unknown about marijuana, NIDA noted, “researchers are still studying how long marijuana’s effects last and whether some changes may be permanent.” 

Finally, while some states recognize “medical marijuana” there is no currently accepted medical use. Unlike other drugs in Schedule III, marijuana is not FDA approved to treat or cure any disease and it is not available for prescription in any state. In 2023, the American Medical Association adopted a position statement that “encourages hospitals and health systems to: (a) not recommend patient use of non-FDA approved cannabis or cannabis-derived products within healthcare facilities until such time as federal laws or regulations permit its use; and (b) educate medical staffs on cannabis use, effects and cannabis withdrawal syndrome.”

For far too long imaginations have run wild and conspiracy theories and ignorance have demonized Marijuana and those that use it. Alcohol went through the same thing and now it's a State regulated product with Federal oversight. The 21st Amendment repealed the 18th Amendment that prohibited Alcohol and put the power to regulate in the hands of the States with Federal oversight. Marijuana should be treated like Alcohol and afford the same respect and dignity for those who consume Marijuana. Marijuana should be regulated in the same fashion as Alcohol. Marijuana should not be restricted to a Schedule III classification but enjoy complete Legality for Adults. However, this is a process, so moving Marijuana from  Schedule I to Schedule III is the first step to ending the illegal Prohibition of Marijuana that is not based on facts, truths, or science. The reality is people self-medicate. Self-medication can be the use of drugs, alcohol, food, sexual stimulation, visual, and audible stimulation as well as meditation with complete silence and the absence of all stimuli. This plant has been around longer than humans. There is a reason why there are receptors specifically for THC in the human brain. Researchers have identified two cannabinoid receptors: CB1, predominantly present in the nervous system, connective tissues, gonads, glands, and organs; and CB2, predominantly found in the immune system and its associated structures. Many tissues contain both CB1 and CB2 receptors, each linked to a different action. Just as with any substance whether it be food, drink, or medications, there is a potential for addiction and abuse which is completely reliant on the subject using the substance and the substance being used. That being said, not everyone likes Alcohol, and not everyone likes Marijuana, and many don't like either one of those. But the question at hand is, ""Can Adults make their own choices when it comes to the use of substances that can impair their cognitive abilities and get inebriated if they so choose, provided that they are not attempting suicide, and the substance is not known to cause death, used responsibly, and they are not intoxicated while operating a vehicle or heavy or dangerous machinery?"" There are health risks associated with the use of Marijuana, but that is heavily dependent on the user, what form the Marijuana is in, the concentration levels of the different THC that are present, as well as what strain-specific genetics the Marijuana possesses for what other cannabinoids are present. Just as with Medication and Alcohol, Marijuana can reveal unknown mental health issues or other underlying physical health issues. Smoking Marijuana depending on the method used, can contain many strong tars and resins similar to cigarettes, or it can be free of all tars with live resins when vaped with only naturally derived hemp distillates free of all pesticides and chemicals and naturally occurring terpenes. Marijuana can also be infused with food directly, or edibles such as gummies for those who do not wish to smoke or vape but still want the benefits that Marijuana can provide them. In conclusion, Marijuana does have Medicinal uses, and rescheduling from I to III is appropriate at this time, however, this is still not representative of how Marijuana should be regulated because Marijuana does not present the same level of potential injury or death from overdose by the consumption of Marijuana in healthy individuals. For unhealthy individuals, the question would be do the benefits outweigh the risks associated with their health conditions and goals and consulting with their Doctor(s).

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether – thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states – I nonetheless do not oppose the factual basis underlying HHS’ recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower.

This is an important step toward a change in marijuana policy that addresses the decades-long discrimination against Black and Brown communities. 



Taking marijuana out of the same classification as more harmful substances like methamphetamine and heroin will give a huge boost to cannabis researchers and those in the cannabis business, and set the stage for further reparative measures for impacted communities. 



Reclassifying marijuana is a necessary step that will move the needle in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy and I urge you to pass this new rule and push back against this nation’s archaic laws against cannabis possession.

I am providing comments in support of the reclassification of botanical cannabis (Docket No. DEA–1362).

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether – thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states – I nonetheless do not oppose the factual basis underlying HHS’ recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower. It would be arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to reject HHS’s findings of fact and to maintain existing prohibitions of the cannabis plant.

I am grateful for the recognition that marijuana should not be classified a ""Schedule I"" substance, but I hope we can move beyond reclassification and remove it altogether from the CSA. At this point, a step in the right direction isn't enough to rectify all the harms, not to mention the confusion and complications, of continuing to criminalize marijuana.  Most citizens agree that the war on drugs has been a complete failure, and it's time to stand up to this realization -- with a decisive stand on Marijuana. 

The current proposal will not help us to rectify the serious harms inflicted on those who are subject to arrest, those currently sentenced and imprisoned., or those who continue to suffer the consequences of having been arrested. We all know these people are more likely to be in marginalized populations, and that our laws have kept them impoverished. 

It's time for public health and equity to drive such decisions.  We all want to protect our children but this conviction is a poor excuse for continuing to criminalize marijuana. As it is, our children have easy access to marijuana and have no idea what it contains, nor does the seller care if buyers are underage. It is clear that we need to regulate rather than criminalize marijuana, as we did with alcohol. 

I admire the Biden Administration’s recognition that our policies have racist roots that gave way to a mind set that continues to discriminate and ruin the lives of too many people who could be productive.  It's about human rights and we deserve a policy that ensures health and well-being rather than punishment.  It makes no sense to want to continue failed practices that are costly to individuals and their families as well as society as a whole. 

President Biden understands the common sense of decriminalizing marijuana. It is crucial for the DEA to support this stance and be a part of restoring justice, and ruling to repair the harms inflicted by policies that are out of step with today's sensibilities and drain resources from other important societal needs.

I  strongly support the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. This is an important and necessary step towards modernizing our nation's drug policies, reflecting current scientific understanding of cannabis' potential benefits and harms.



For too long, marijuana has been categorized alongside highly dangerous substances like methamphetamine, despite mounting evidence suggesting its relative safety. Reclassifying it to Schedule III would not only acknowledge this reality but also pave the way for further research into its medicinal properties and potential risks.



Furthermore, reclassification would provide much-needed regulatory clarity for businesses operating within the burgeoning cannabis industry. The tax benefits that stand to accrue from such a move could stimulate economic growth and job creation in communities across America.



I urge you to consider these points as you review this critical proposal. Reclassifying marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act is a commonsense move that aligns with both public sentiment and scientific evidence. It represents another significant step forward in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy.



Thank you for your attention to this matter.

I urge the Drug Enforcement Agency to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act, a move that would mark a step toward rectifying the harms caused by its criminalization. 

By de-scheduling cannabis, the federal government would be following the lead of 31 states that have already decriminalized the drug. The majority of people in the U.S.—70 percent, according to a November 2023 Gallup poll—support cannabis legalization. 

But rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, as the Department of Health & Human Services and the DEA have proposed, is insufficient. If cannabis remains on the CSA, people can continue to face penalties at the federal level for possession, including arrest and incarceration, which lead to a lifetime of consequences that impact someone’s ability to secure employment, housing, public benefits, educational opportunities, and more. 

The criminalization of cannabis—a legacy of the War on Drugs—was a policy decision rooted in racism.

The HHS appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

Cannabis has a currently accepted medical use, and its abuse potential does not warrant its classification as a Schedule I substance. HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision. Over 30,000 healthcare practitioners in 38 states recommend it to more than six million registered patients, making marijuana’s medical use in treatment and its medical application crystal clear. Surveys of healthcare professionals, such as a 2022 study by the CDC, show that over two-thirds believe in its medical use, and numerous medical associations support legal access to cannabis for medical purposes.

HHS’s review accurately finds cannabis to be safer than many other controlled substances, and cannabis clearly does not meet the criteria of a Schedule I or II substance. Cannabis poses lower public health risks compared to Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine, and compared to Schedule IV drugs like benzodiazepine. Cannabis also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. This low public health risk of cannabis is well supported based on a robust evaluation of epidemiological evidence, including overdose deaths.

Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines, a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled.” HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

Extensive clinical research—including FDA-approved trials—and widespread medical treatment in the United States support the medical efficacy and low abuse potential of cannabis. Based on this evidence, cannabis should be rescheduled to Schedule III to reflect its medical benefits and relative safety. While complete removal from the Controlled Substances Act would better promote public health and safety and align federal policy with state laws, I support and believe the medical evidence and factual basis support HHS’s recommendation to reschedule cannabis to Schedule III.",Supports,0.9944981898967258

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it’s time to end this country’s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA’s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA. Now is the time.

Your administration is failing Black and brown people. Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients’ access to medical marijuana. 

Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won’t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.

The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or “descheduling.” Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. 

Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana’s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. 

Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.

Given the Biden Administration’s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.

President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden’s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization.

Unlike opioids, which pose risks of dependence and adverse reactions, cannabis offers a safer alternative for pain management, allowing me to function effectively in daily life without the cognitive impairment or hangover effects. Furthermore, the accessibility of medical cannabis has empowered me to take control of my health decisions, tailoring my treatment to meet my individual needs and preferences.

This being said, because of the current classification of marijuana as a Schedule I substance, I was recently denied employment after a positive marijuana drug screening. The positive test result came after abstaining from THC for 22 days, and my job offer was rescinded even after presenting a valid physician recommendation due to the DEAs classification of marijuana as a Schedule I drug. Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III would acknowledge its recognized medical value, facilitate further research, and alleviate unnecessary barriers to employment for qualified applicants like myself with a medical need to use cannabis for treatment. 

In conclusion, I strongly endorse the reclassification of marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III and urge the DEA to prioritize the well-being and rights of patients by expediting this process. Thank you for considering my input and for your dedication to public health and safety.

Sincerely,
Dina Mora

I have a family member who suffers with Parkinson’s who would greatly benefit from the rescheduling of marijuana. Please help my family and many other families across the country who need access to marijuana and whose pain could be greatly reduced by your actions to do this as soon as possible. While your actions on this will be just the first of many needed steps, it will pave the way for many, much needed medical advances.

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether – thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states – I nonetheless do not oppose the factual basis underlying HHS’ recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower. It would be arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to reject HHS’s findings of fact and to maintain existing prohibitions of the cannabis plant.",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,0.9030592929806068

I am writing to express my support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. 



This is an important step toward a change in marijuana policy that addresses the decades-long discrimination against Black and Brown communities. 



Taking marijuana out of the same classification as more harmful substances like methamphetamine and heroin will give a huge boost to cannabis researchers and those in the cannabis business, and set the stage for further reparative measures for impacted communities. 



Reclassifying marijuana is a necessary step that will move the needle in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy and I urge you to pass this new rule and push back against this nation’s archaic laws against cannabis possession.

Absolutely, and it is ridiculous that it is even that high. However, I want to focus this comment on the proposed move.  My wife had never used any type of cannabis until she was diagnosed with cancer several years ago.  It helped immensely.  There are a plethora of scientific studies that prove this, not to mention the millions upon millions of real world people of all walks of life in multiple countries that have experienced positive outcomes for a multitude of issues.  Most of the US population has access to medical cannabis already. Many of the States that have historically lobbied against cannabis reform have medical programs.  Why would they approve these programs if there was no medical benefit?   There is no risk of overdose. It is safer and immensely more beneficial than alcohol. Opponents stress the fact that there are more sophisticated strains, stronger doses, etc.  All the more reason to move it to S3 in order to regulate and study it.  You cannot use stronger doses as a reason against this change when 110 proof alcohol is readily available at a grocery store and could easily put someone in the hospital or kill someone. Science has only begun to discover all of the benefits of this wonderful plant. I applaud the administrative branch of our government for proposing this baby step in the absence of any legislative movement.  It's time this government listens to science and the majority of the people instead of the loudest politician or the big pharma and tobacco lobby groups. I am also reading that there could be a ""hearing"" to discuss this proposal.  I find that ludicrous. This country was founded on ""We the People"". The people in the States that make up this great nation have spoken with their votes. Minority groups with slanted agendas should not have a voice in this.

DEA-2024-0059-5740,2024-05-26T04:00Z,Dillon Hicks,"I am writing to strongly advocate for the complete descheduling of marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III may bring some benefits, it does not address the fundamental issues caused by the current classification under federal law.

Descheduling marijuana is essential to align federal policies with the growing acceptance and legalization of cannabis at the state level. Currently, 23 states have legalized recreational marijuana, and 38 states have approved medical marijuana use. This discrepancy creates significant legal and regulatory conflicts that only full descheduling can resolve.

Descheduling will:
1. Eliminate Criminal Penalties: Rescheduling still subjects individuals to criminal penalties for marijuana-related activities, disproportionately affecting Black and Brown communities. Descheduling will help end the punitive measures that have devastated lives and perpetuated systemic racial injustices.
2. Facilitate Comprehensive Research: Full descheduling will remove the barriers to research, allowing scientists to study marijuana's full potential without the constraints of federal scheduling. This will enable more robust and nuanced understanding of its medical benefits and risks.
3. Support Economic Growth: By fully descheduling, cannabis businesses can operate without the fear of federal interference, promoting economic development and job creation. It will also allow businesses to access banking services and take standard tax deductions, fostering a fairer economic environment.
4. Public Health and Safety: Descheduling allows for the establishment of a regulatory framework focused on public health and safety, similar to the regulation of alcohol and tobacco. This will ensure product safety, proper labeling, and responsible consumption.

The current Schedule I classification is outdated and not reflective of marijuana's medical benefits or its relatively low risk compared to other substances. The federal government must take this opportunity to enact meaningful reform that acknowledges the failures of the War on Drugs and moves towards a more just and effective drug policy.

I urge the DEA to consider the overwhelming public support for marijuana legalization and take the necessary steps to deschedule marijuana completely. This action will better serve public health, safety, and justice.",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,0.2813090837355844

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

I am writing to express my strong support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. This is an important and necessary step towards modernizing our nation's drug policies, reflecting current scientific understanding of cannabis' potential benefits and harms.



For too long, marijuana has been categorized alongside highly dangerous substances like methamphetamine, despite mounting evidence suggesting its relative safety. Reclassifying it to Schedule III would not only acknowledge this reality but also pave the way for further research into its medicinal properties and potential risks.



Furthermore, reclassification would provide much-needed regulatory clarity for businesses operating within the burgeoning cannabis industry. The tax benefits that stand to accrue from such a move could stimulate economic growth and job creation in communities across America.



I urge you to consider these points as you review this critical proposal. Reclassifying marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act is a commonsense move that aligns with both public sentiment and scientific evidence. It represents another significant step forward in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy.

There were several pesticides sprayed on the plants that were outside the state regulated list.  One pesticide, Ovation, an ovaricide used for spider mites made my ovary blow up like a balloon and I had to have my ovary surgically removed.  I talked with agriculture pesticide professor, Cecil Tharp, at Montana State university.  He was able to match several sprays to my symptoms.  He told me most pesticides attack the reproductive system of bugs.  I went to the ceo wheezing and begging him to destroy the crop that made me and others in the dispensary sick. He put it on sale.  I stopped using the product and switched to a friend's unsprayed homegrow and all my symptoms cleared overnight.  The symptoms included extreme headaches above the eye, morning puking every day, extreme moodiness like pms but worse, asthmatic cough, congestion,  wheezing, phlegm with black flecks in it, sharp lower abdomen pains,  and welts where I touched it.  The men who got sick had these symptoms minus the moodiness and sharp ovary pains of the ovaricide.  The women who were sick started complaining about trips to the obgyn for an extreme pain.  I remembered I had that same pain when I was smoking the stuff that they were still buying on sale.  I went to my local hospital where they gave me an ultrasound and said, ""you don't feel that thing in you?"" I said I had only felt that pain when I was smoking that tainted weed.  I had a highly unusual thick walled ovarian cyst the size of a newborns head and was on bedrest until surgery.  When I met Dr. Tharp, I told him that the company said they were spraying Ovation. He said, ""That's an ovaricide!"" The puking was from neem which he did his PhD on and said it disrupts the digestive system.  Permethrin and pyrethrins attack the optic nerve of bugs causing the headaches above the eye.  The phlegm with black flecks was Avid. He asked if we were random blind testing.  I told him were are mandatory batch testing.  He said, ""That'll never work."" The companies pay the labs to test for them and also call them to ask what to spray that's not on the list.  Ovation, used for spider mites, common in cannabis still is unregulated.  The lab techs and inspectors track bugs from grow to grow making it almost impossible for indoor grows to not spray.  The inspectors should be randomly taking samples off shelves or from distribution, assigning it a number, and blind testing it against a random 100 from the Israel list of 202 pesticides through a subcontracted mj lab that has gone through the procurement process with the state.  Random blind, or nevermind! That's one of my mantras.  Another is... concentrated contamination becomes concentrated.  Schedule 3, I hope would allow the feds to do random blind testing and subcontract with state labs at universities like Cecil Tharps lab.  As most pesticides attack the reproductive systems, I believe that we are in the middle of an epidemic that could sterilize a generation. Have you seen the fertility rate drop? It correlates with states that have recreational mj. I hope to have grandchildren and my kids know what happened to me.  But the teens tell me that the same company that poisoned me, Lionheart in Montana, is the brand of vapes they can easily get on the black market today.  The bulk of the crop that wasn't on the shelf went to a 3rd party lab that senator ellie boldman had set up while passing test and track laws in the 2017 legislative session. She also set up a testing lab for her chemist husband.  3rd party extractions was amended out of the bill, so her and my poisoner sued the state to be able to process together.  They lost, but not before they turned the poison crop into vape cartridges and flooded the middle and high schools. Montana still has the lowest number of regulated pesticides at 14. But, mandatory batch testing is easily corrupted no matter the number as seen in California by the June 14, 2024 LA times article.  Please do a round of random blind testing on the legal shelves.  The consumer believes that testing makes these products safe.  The consumers are still getting sick in all legal states.  In fact, I would guess legal product is dirtiest because of heavy savvy marketing by chemical companies.  With a neem allergy diagnosis in place of a CHS diagnosis, I finally stopped the regular puking I had experienced for years of going gluten free to try to get it in check.  I still smoke unsprayed with no side effects despite hitting acute toxicity. I've attached the LA Times article for your review.  No spray, or no way! ",Unclear,0.1158939624911959

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value.

While I appreciate the Biden Administration’s efforts, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling.  Instead of keeping marijuana illegal, it’s time to end the failed policy of criminalization and regulate marijuana and other controlled substances similar to alcohol, which is more dangerous substance.

The following facts in history show that  our past presidents benefited from now illegal substances and I hope that Biden Administration brings justice to present and past incarcerated population, decriminalize migration by eliminating deportations for drug offenses, and reduce law enforcement corruption:  

1.  Sara Ann Roosevelt (née Delano; September 21, 1854 – September 7, 1941) was the second wife of James Roosevelt I (from 1880), the mother of President of the United States Franklin Delano Roosevelt, her only child, and subsequently the mother-in-law of Eleanor Roosevelt.  Sara Ann Delano grew up in Newburgh, New York, and spent three years in Hong Kong, while her father, Warren Delano Jr., was an opium exporter to China.  She gave birth to Franklin  Roosevelt in 1882.

2.  Warren Delano Jr. (July 13, 1809 – January 17, 1898) was an American merchant who made a large fortune exporting opium into Canton (now Guangzhou), China. He was the maternal grandfather of U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization and arrests, will not release anyone in prison for marijuana, will not expunge previous marijuana arrests and will not end deportations,  immigration consequences.  Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits or bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry, similar to alcohol, most dangerous, but legal substance.  

Rescheduling will not facilitate patients’ access to medical marijuana and would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.

Most important, rescheduling will not end corruption of law enforcement, thru which many innocent persons were convicted of conspiracy controlled substance offenses, the easiest way to obtain a criminal conviction by corrupt prosecutors.

The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is “descheduling.”  Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for controlled substances, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. 

Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana’s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the impacts of prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences, such as mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing,  among other detrimental consequences that will continue under rescheduling. 

For decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing prohibition, similar to failed alcohol prohibition in the last century, at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena.  The U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.

President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana and end the failed and corrupt war on drugs.  I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden’s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,0.6295705687658286
DEA-2024-0059-22446,2024-06-19T04:00Z,Jonathan Moore,"As an avid marijuana enthusiast from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, I am voicing my support for the reclassification of botanical cannabis (Docket No. DEA–1362).
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has rightly recognized that cannabis has a legitimate medical use and that its potential for abuse does not justify its classification as a Schedule I or II substance.
This acknowledgment by HHS is backed by the medical community’s broad consensus on the therapeutic benefits of cannabis, particularly in pain management, and its relatively safe administration under medical guidance.
With 38 states overseeing the cultivation and distribution of botanical cannabis to qualified patients, and approximately six million individuals actively participating in these programs alongside 30,000 healthcare professionals, it’s evident that medical cannabis can be managed responsibly. The longstanding operation of these state programs and the absence of any state revoking access to plant-based medical cannabis underscore its safe and effective regulation.
Nationally, 69 percent of healthcare providers recognize the medicinal value of cannabis, and over a quarter have recommended it to their patients, as per the 2022 survey data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Moreover, numerous medical organizations, including the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, have called on the federal government to swiftly legalize cannabis for medicinal purposes.
Cannabis’s safety profile is notably better than many controlled substances, and it certainly does not fulfill the stringent criteria for inclusion in Schedule I or II. HHS has specifically noted that the public health risks associated with marijuana are minimal, especially when compared to other substances like benzodiazepines—a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is not scheduled. HHS has found no significant safety concerns that would suggest that the medicinal use of marijuana presents an unacceptable risk, especially in cases where there is credible scientific evidence of its therapeutic benefits.
To conclude, cannabis does not meet the criteria for a Schedule I or II substance. While my personal stance is that cannabis should be entirely removed from the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to align with the policies of most US states, I do not dispute HHS’s recommendation to reclassify botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower. It would be unjust and unreasonable for the DEA to disregard the factual findings of HHS and to continue the prohibition of the cannabis plant.",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,0.5331507979193516
DEA-2024-0059-14924,2024-06-10T04:00Z,Anonymous,"Rescheduling cannabis to Schedule III is a multifaceted decision that considers scientific evidence, medical research, and societal impacts. Here's a comprehensive explanation supported by reputable scientific and medical journals:

    Therapeutic Potential: Numerous studies published in reputable journals such as JAMA and The New England Journal of Medicine have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of cannabis for various medical conditions. For example, a review published in JAMA concluded that there is substantial evidence supporting the use of cannabis or cannabinoids for chronic pain management.

    Safety Profile: Research published in journals like Addiction and Drug and Alcohol Dependence has shown that cannabis has a relatively low potential for harm compared to other substances like alcohol and tobacco. A study published in The Lancet Psychiatry found that the overall risk of harm associated with cannabis use is low compared to other psychoactive substances.

    Regulatory Oversight: Placing cannabis in Schedule III would ensure appropriate regulatory oversight while still allowing for medical use. This approach has been advocated by researchers and medical professionals in journals such as The Journal of Clinical Pharmacology and Drug and Alcohol Review. Rescheduling cannabis would enable healthcare providers to prescribe it more confidently, ensuring that patients receive safe and effective treatments.

    Economic Benefits: Research published in journals like The American Journal of Public Health and The Journal of Law and Economics has highlighted the potential economic benefits of legalizing and regulating cannabis. These studies have shown that legalization can generate significant tax revenue, create jobs, and reduce the burden on the criminal justice system.

    Social Justice: Rescheduling cannabis to Schedule III could address the racial disparities in drug enforcement. Studies published in journals such as The American Journal of Public Health and The Drug Policy Alliance have documented the disproportionate impact of cannabis prohibition on communities of color. By reducing penalties for cannabis possession and distribution, rescheduling could help alleviate these disparities.

In conclusion, rescheduling cannabis to Schedule III is supported by a wealth of scientific evidence and medical research. It would allow for the recognition of its therapeutic potential, ensure regulatory oversight, and address social justice concerns.",Supports,0.5807775443644886

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether – thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states – I nonetheless do not oppose the factual basis underlying HHS’ recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower. It would be arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to reject HHS’s findings of fact and to maintain existing prohibitions of the cannabis plant.

DEA-2024-0059-33653,2024-07-18T04:00Z,Nicholas Marcantuono,"I personally have performed early intervention counseling for youth under the age of 18. Since marijuana has been legalized in New Jersey, we have seen a huge drop in perception of harm among youth. These youth I have worked with universally state there is no danger socially or physically to using THC products. Prevention coalitions I work with are attempting to increase that perception of harm and lower youth usage rates, however I fear that the rescheduling of this substance may harm our efforts. If youth see that marijuana is being acknowledged as less dangerous, they will use that excuse to justify their behaviors further. This alone is enough of a reason not to reschedule.

I am writing to register my opposition to the recommendation to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. 

Rescheduling marijuana would allow the marijuana industry to deduct normal business expenses, including advertising and marketing expenses. This would make the industry profitable and incentivize them to spend even more on advertising and marketing.  This would likely cause marijuana sales and the harms associated with marijuana use to rise in tandem. Big Tobacco taught us the deleterious impact of advertising on youth: the more teens are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely they are to start smoking. The same will be true with marijuana. The marijuana industry will undoubtedly take a page out of Big Tobacco’s marketing playbook, making marijuana use look glamorous and benign with celebrity endorsements, candy flavoring (already seen in marijuana edibles), product placement in movies, and more. Even without the expected deluge of ads and marketing, marijuana use is at an all-time high. Teen use of marijuana is at 30- year high, with more teens reporting smoking marijuana than tobacco. Among young adults 19 to 30, 26% used in the past month compared to 17% in 2011, and 11% were daily users, up from 6% in 2011. 

HHS' recommendation failed to account for actual/relative potential for abuse or harms associated with use. Contrary to popular narrative, marijuana can be addictive. In fact, as many as 1 in 3 past year marijuana users met the clinical criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder. People who self-medicate with marijuana are not exempt from becoming addicted. According to research at Massachusetts General Hospital, “using cannabis products to treat pain, anxiety and depression failed to improve these symptoms while doubling the risk of developing the addictive symptoms of cannabis use disorder.” 

With the exception of one study of medical marijuana patients in Maryland, the review from HHS failed to acknowledge or consider the link between marijuana and psychosis. This is especially concerning in light of the rising potency of marijuana. Daily users of marijuana over 10% THC are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than non-users. A 2023 study in Denmark determined that 30% of cases of schizophrenia among 21–30-year-old males could have been averted if cannabis use disorder had been prevented. A 2022 study found that hospital discharges for marijuana-associated psychosis were higher in states with legal marijuana, another precursor if those who push full-scale commercialization have their way. 

Marijuana use is especially concerning in young people, a factor HHS failed to adequately address. The National Center for Education Statistics said, “adolescent marijuana use has been associated with lower academic performance and a higher risk of dropping out of high school.”  Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, warns, “Youth who use marijuana regularly are more likely to have a hard time learning, problems remembering, and lower math and reading scores. These effects can last weeks after the last time they used marijuana.” Recognizing that much remains unknown about marijuana, NIDA noted, “researchers are still studying how long marijuana’s effects last and whether some changes may be permanent.” 

Finally, while some states recognize “medical marijuana” there is no currently accepted medical use. Unlike other drugs in Schedule III, marijuana is not FDA approved to treat or cure any disease and it is not available for prescription in any state. In 2023, the American Medical Association adopted a position statement that “encourages hospitals and health systems to: (a) not recommend patient use of non-FDA approved cannabis or cannabis-derived products within healthcare facilities until such time as federal laws or regulations permit its use; and (b) educate medical staffs on cannabis use, effects and cannabis withdrawal syndrome.”

As a concerned citizen and advocate for sensible drug policy, I believe that it is time for our government to embrace evidence-based approaches that prioritize public health and individual freedoms.
The current prohibition of marijuana has led to countless injustices, disproportionately impacting communities of color and perpetuating a cycle of incarceration and social inequality. Legalization presents an opportunity to rectify these wrongs by ending the criminalization of individuals for non-violent marijuana offenses and by implementing measures to repair the harm done to communities affected by the war on drugs.
Moreover, the legalization of marijuana offers significant economic benefits. By creating a legal market for marijuana, we can generate tax revenue that can be reinvested into our communities, funding education, healthcare, and substance abuse prevention programs. Additionally, legalization will create jobs and stimulate economic growth in sectors such as agriculture, retail, and tourism.
Furthermore, regulating marijuana will ensure product safety and quality control, protecting consumers from the risks associated with unregulated products on the black market. With proper regulations in place, we can promote responsible use and reduce the potential harms associated with marijuana consumption.
It is time for our government to listen to the will of the people and enact policies that reflect the realities of marijuana use in our society. Legalization and regulation are not only a matter of personal freedom but also a matter of social justice and economic progress.

But rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, as the Department of Health & Human Services and the DEA have proposed, is insufficient. If cannabis remains on the CSA, people can continue to face penalties at the federal level for possession, including arrest and incarceration, which lead to a lifetime of consequences that impact someone’s ability to secure employment, housing, public benefits, educational opportunities, and more.

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis is a relatively harmless substance that has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

It's current classification as Schedule I is hyperbolic in the extreme.

I am writing to express my strong support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. This is an important and necessary step towards modernizing our nation's drug policies, reflecting current scientific understanding of cannabis' potential benefits and harms.



For too long, marijuana has been categorized alongside highly dangerous substances like methamphetamine, despite mounting evidence suggesting its relative safety. Reclassifying it to Schedule III would not only acknowledge this reality but also pave the way for further research into its medicinal properties and potential risks.



Furthermore, reclassification would provide much-needed regulatory clarity for businesses operating within the burgeoning cannabis industry. The tax benefits that stand to accrue from such a move could stimulate economic growth and job creation in communities across America.



I urge you to consider these points as you review this critical proposal. Reclassifying marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act is a commonsense move that aligns with both public sentiment and scientific evidence. It represents another significant step forward in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy.

While heroin was grabbing the headlines over five years ago our group was seeing an increase in the number of families whose loved ones were experiencing psychotic episodes after using too much cannabis. It came about slowly but now alcohol and cannabis abuse are the top two ""offenders"" within our families. Over the past five years I know of at least eight families who have seen their offspring admitted to psychiatric hospitals.  Marijuana was the drug of choice. This trend toward psychotic episodes has stayed constant because the users have believed that if the States legalized cannabis then it must be ""okay"". Unfortunately, treating someone with a cannabis-induced psychosis is tricky and the medical world has not quite found a standard way to help these people.  The hope is that a victim will only experience one psychotic episode and maybe heal over a five-year period.  Doctors are poorly educated on how to help these patients.  A generation is being lost to the slowed brain development, lethargy, increased agitation, and lack of motivation caused by overuse of cannabis.

The CDC states that approximately 3 in 10 people who use marijuana have Cannabis Use Disorder.  That means they have become addicted.

NIDA of NIH states that between 9 and 30 percent of marijuana users develop Cannabis Use Disorder.

A reasonable conjecture would be that many patients in residential rehabilitation centers have a Cannabis Use Disorder because the users' lives have become unmanageable. It would be logical to believe that many of these are in the age range of 15 to 30, a generation that will meet full adulthood in a few years.

Just because states have legalized it in many cases doesn't mean that those legislators understood what they were doing.  Many states have thought the legalization would bring money into State coffers. That's what they were told by the pro-legalization lobbyists who would make money from the sales. 

If NIDA wishes to conduct more research on cannabis then carve out an exception that allows Federally sponsored researchers to do that. It's irresponsible to make a blanket statement that cannabis has a CAMU. While certain properties of cannabis might be beneficial, allow NIDA to do in-depth research to zero in with great detail to understand exactly what is good and bad about the plant.

To move marijuana from Schedule 1 to Schedule III just sends another message to the populace that there's no danger in consuming it. My once-addicted son agrees with me now that it should not be legalized.

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether – thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states – I nonetheless do not oppose the factual basis underlying HHS’ recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower. It would be arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to reject HHS’s findings of fact and to maintain existing prohibitions of the cannabis plant. ",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,1.000000000000001

I am writing to express my support for the reclassification of cannabis to Schedule III under federal law, as recommended by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and approved by the DEA on April 30th, 2024.

The reclassification of cannabis to Schedule III is a significant and necessary step in recognizing the evolving understanding of the substance’s medical and therapeutic benefits. Here are several reasons why this reclassification is important:

	1.	Medical Benefits: Numerous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of cannabis in treating various medical conditions such as chronic pain, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and chemotherapy-induced nausea. By moving cannabis to Schedule III, it becomes more accessible for medical research, allowing scientists to further explore its potential benefits and develop standardized treatments.
	2.	Reduced Stigma: The current classification of cannabis as a Schedule I drug, alongside substances like heroin and LSD, perpetuates a stigma that undermines its legitimate medical use. Reclassifying cannabis to Schedule III acknowledges its medical utility and helps to reduce the negative perceptions associated with its use.
	3.	Regulatory Consistency: Many states have already legalized cannabis for medical and recreational use. However, the disparity between state and federal laws creates confusion and inconsistency in regulation and enforcement. Reclassifying cannabis at the federal level would help to harmonize these laws and provide clearer guidelines for patients, healthcare providers, and businesses.
	4.	Economic Impact: The legal cannabis industry has generated significant economic benefits, including job creation, tax revenue, and investment opportunities. Reclassification can further stimulate economic growth by removing barriers to banking, research, and development, thus fostering innovation and expansion within the industry.
	5.	Criminal Justice Reform: The reclassification of cannabis can contribute to broader criminal justice reform by reducing the number of non-violent drug offenses related to cannabis. This can help to alleviate the burden on the legal system and reduce the disproportionate impact of cannabis-related arrests and convictions on marginalized communities.

In conclusion, reclassifying cannabis to Schedule III is a progressive and science-based approach that aligns with current research and societal trends. It supports medical advancement, economic growth, regulatory clarity, and social justice. I urge the DEA and other regulatory bodies to finalize this reclassification and continue to develop policies that reflect the evolving landscape of cannabis research and use.

My one client uses medical Marijuana to keep his seizure disorder at bay. He has tried numerous types of seizure medications prior to medical Marijuana. None of them were as effective at preventing seizures as the marijuana for him. 
My second client has a bone cyst in their hip and suffers from fibromyalgia and EDS. These disorders leave my client is severe pain daily. Without medical Marijuana this person would be completely dependent on opiates to manage their pain. Not they only have to use opiates when they have severe flair ups, instead of daily. These are 2 people who live in the Minneapolis area who's lives are positively effected both medically and mentally by the medical Marijuana program. Without marijuana these people would loose their independence. 
The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

It is a scheduled substance not based on any science, but because of politics, a political lie, a complete fabrication by Richard Nixon’s political team, as confirmed by John Ehrlichman: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ehrlichman), 
“You want to know what this was really all about?” he asked with the bluntness of a man who, after public disgrace and a stretch in federal prison, had little left to protect. “The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”

I am writing to express my support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. 



This is an important step toward a change in marijuana policy that addresses the decades-long discrimination against Black and Brown communities. 



Taking marijuana out of the same classification as more harmful substances like methamphetamine and heroin will give a huge boost to cannabis researchers and those in the cannabis business, and set the stage for further reparative measures for impacted communities. 



Reclassifying marijuana is a necessary step that will move the needle in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy and I urge you to pass this new rule and push back against this nation’s archaic laws against cannabis possession. 



Thank you.

While I appreciate the Biden Administration’s efforts to reconsider marijuana’s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance,  rescheduling is insufficient. It’s time to end this country’s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA’s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to remove marijuana from the CSA.

Marijuana should be removed from the CSA and be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences, or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients’ access to medical marijuana. 

Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won’t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.

The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or “descheduling.” Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. 

Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana’s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. 

Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.

Given the Biden Administration’s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.

President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden’s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,0.9942486500733106

Every day, plenty of people that work for this country and provide tax money for this country intake marijuana for a plethora of personal reasons. Some people can’t even make it out of bed in the morning to go to work, trying to afford their bills, therefore giving tax money to this country without intaking marijuana to take their pain away enough to be conductive members of society. Over 50% of US adults have tried or use marijuana. The majority is not being heard and this is anti-democracy. Maybe if the medical system in this country was far more developed and people could survive, this wouldn’t be an issue. But due to no action being taken in helping Americans any other way, It’s in my opinion the smartest option to unschedule marijuana, nothing else is being done to help us.

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.

Cannabis is completely safe and natural. It has caused 0 (ZERO) deaths due to overdose in over 100 years. It has very little chance of causing an addiction, unlike perscription painkillers, and the withdrawal symptoms are FAR less detrimental to quality of life, at most a person may be a bit irratable, restless, and nauseated. It should not be (and should never have been) a Schedule I drug, as there are many medical benefits to using Marijuana, from quelling nausea, stopping Parkinson's tremors, to reducing the risk of seizures, and has a much lower risk of abuse and dependency than Alcahol or cigarettes, which are not even classified as a drug in the first place. It has improved quality of life for THOUSANDS of people in the country, and should not be used for fear mongering as it has been used.

As a point of personal experience, my wife was previously prescribed highly addictive opioid based painkillers to help alleviate her chronic pain due to fibromyalgia. At one point this lead to a brush with disaster as she nearly overdosed and spent a week in the ICU when she unintentionally over medicated herself. She has since quit taking all the prescribed opioids and uses cannabis to help manage this chronic condition. While it doesn't cure the underlying issue, cannabis is a far less deadly method to provide needed pain relief.

I am writing to express my support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. 



This is an important step toward a change in marijuana policy that addresses the decades-long discrimination against Black and Brown communities. 



Taking marijuana out of the same classification as more harmful substances like methamphetamine and heroin will give a huge boost to cannabis researchers and those in the cannabis business, and set the stage for further reparative measures for impacted communities. 



Reclassifying marijuana is a necessary step that will move the needle in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy and I urge you to pass this new rule and push back against this nation’s archaic laws against cannabis possession.

Given the evolving understanding of cannabis' therapeutic properties and its relatively low potential for abuse and dependence compared to substances in Schedules III through V, a more appropriate regulatory approach would be either descheduling cannabis altogether or relegating it to Schedule V.

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

Personally, cannabis has helped me tremendously for terrible and chronic neck pain. I've had multiple surgeries to address the issue, but I still have extreme muscle tension, which causes neck pain, terrible headaches, and interferes with my productivity. Cannabis has been the only thing that brings relief to my neck pain/muscle tension. 

Cannabis has saved me from years of opioids, or worse, possible opioid dependency. 

Since introducing cannabis to my neck pain management regimen, I've lost weight, been able to work out more, and been able to enjoy simple things like yard work, which would otherwise cause debilitating neck pain.

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation.

DEA-2024-0059-20898,2024-06-18T04:00Z,Jill Fuqua,"I started smoking marijuana at the age of 16 and became addicted to it and alcohol. I was doing my best to try to medicate severe depression and anxiety. Marijuana was a gateway drug for me into using harder drugs like cocaine, crack, LSD, and mushrooms. This drug is very detrimental to young people and their developing brains and must be kept out of the hands of young adults. I work with law students, and many of them consider marijuana use as a low-risk behavior even though it is illegal in Indiana. This drug nearly ruined my life. It took all my ambition away and kept me from my dream career because it became more important to me than my career goals. I urge you to not reschedule marijuana.

I am writing to register my opposition to the recommendation to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. 

Rescheduling marijuana would allow the marijuana industry to deduct normal business expenses, including advertising and marketing expenses. This would make the industry profitable and incentivize them to spend even more on advertising and marketing.  This would likely cause marijuana sales and the harms associated with marijuana use to rise in tandem. Big Tobacco taught us the deleterious impact of advertising on youth: the more teens are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely they are to start smoking. The same will be true with marijuana. The marijuana industry will undoubtedly take a page out of Big Tobacco’s marketing playbook, making marijuana use look glamorous and benign with celebrity endorsements, candy flavoring (already seen in marijuana edibles), product placement in movies, and more. Even without the expected deluge of ads and marketing, marijuana use is at an all-time high. Teen use of marijuana is at 30- year high, with more teens reporting smoking marijuana than tobacco. Among young adults 19 to 30, 26% used in the past month compared to 17% in 2011, and 11% were daily users, up from 6% in 2011. 

HHS' recommendation failed to account for actual/relative potential for abuse or harms associated with use. Contrary to popular narrative, marijuana can be addictive. In fact, as many as 1 in 3 past year marijuana users met the clinical criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder. People who self-medicate with marijuana are not exempt from becoming addicted. According to research at Massachusetts General Hospital, “using cannabis products to treat pain, anxiety and depression failed to improve these symptoms while doubling the risk of developing the addictive symptoms of cannabis use disorder.” 

With the exception of one study of medical marijuana patients in Maryland, the review from HHS failed to acknowledge or consider the link between marijuana and psychosis. This is especially concerning in light of the rising potency of marijuana. Daily users of marijuana over 10% THC are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than non-users. A 2023 study in Denmark determined that 30% of cases of schizophrenia among 21–30-year-old males could have been averted if cannabis use disorder had been prevented. A 2022 study found that hospital discharges for marijuana-associated psychosis were higher in states with legal marijuana, another precursor if those who push full-scale commercialization have their way. 

Marijuana use is especially concerning in young people, a factor HHS failed to adequately address. The National Center for Education Statistics said, “adolescent marijuana use has been associated with lower academic performance and a higher risk of dropping out of high school.”  Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, warns, “Youth who use marijuana regularly are more likely to have a hard time learning, problems remembering, and lower math and reading scores. These effects can last weeks after the last time they used marijuana.” Recognizing that much remains unknown about marijuana, NIDA noted, “researchers are still studying how long marijuana’s effects last and whether some changes may be permanent.” 

Finally, while some states recognize “medical marijuana” there is no currently accepted medical use. Unlike other drugs in Schedule III, marijuana is not FDA approved to treat or cure any disease and it is not available for prescription in any state. In 2023, the American Medical Association adopted a position statement that “encourages hospitals and health systems to: (a) not recommend patient use of non-FDA approved cannabis or cannabis-derived products within healthcare facilities until such time as federal laws or regulations permit its use; and (b) educate medical staffs on cannabis use, effects and cannabis withdrawal syndrome.”

I am writing to express my concerns with this proposed rule. While I appreciate the Administration’s recognition that marijuana should be removed from Schedule I, this proposed rule falls short and ultimately will not reduce the decades of damage caused by the criminalization of marijuana.  Furthermore, the proposed rule misses an opportunity to align federal policy with where much of the country is headed, and is completely out of step with where most Americans are on this issue.  Rather than rescheduling, I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and instead issue a rule that would completely deschedule marijuana from the CSA.  Marijuana was initially included in the CSA pending a study and review by the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, better known as the Shafer Commission, over 50 years ago.  That study concluded that marijuana was no more dangerous than alcohol and recommended that it be decriminalized.  Nixon rejected this recommendation, and his domestic policy chief was later quoted as saying this decision was predicated on a desire to weaponize criminalization and the so called “War on Drugs” to target Black and Brown people and anti-war protestors. He stated: “We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course, we did.”  We know the devastation this “War on Drugs” has wreaked on Black and Brown communities. In all 50 states, Black people are more likely to be arrested for marijuana offenses than white people, despite similar usage rates.  On average across the nation, a Black person is nearly four times as likely to be arrested for a marijuana offense than a white person. While often touted for its liberalism, in New York City 94 percent of all people arrested for marijuana offenses are people of color. The last 50 years has taught us that we cannot achieve racial justice so long as this “War on Drugs” is allowed to rage.  In addition to the racial injustice linked to criminalizing marijuana, the continued criminalization of marijuana is incredibly fiscally irresponsible. Forty percent of all drug arrests in the U.S. are for marijuana offenses, overwhelmingly for simple possession.  In fact, arrests for marijuana outnumber arrests for all violent crimes combined.  It is estimated that the U.S. spends upwards of $7.6 billion annually on the criminalization of marijuana. Putting aside the real harms caused by criminalization, this is an enormous amount of taxpayer money that could be put to far better use. This money could be used to fund schools, mental health and substance abuse services, proper nutrition for families, and youth programming.  Missouri legalized marijuana in 2020, and it is projected that by the end of 2024 it will have generated $238 million in tax revenue.  The state uses that money to fund drug treatment, veteran services, and other important social programs.  In another example, Colorado generated $1.6 billion in tax revenue within a six-year period to fund schools, literacy programs, and mental health services.    Widespread acceptance of marijuana has increased tremendously in recent decades.  Twenty-four states have completely legalized recreational marijuana, and over half of Americans live in a state where it is legal. Another 14 states have legalized the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes. In one of the most obvious signs that legalization is working, not a single state has reversed its legalization of marijuana. Furthermore, 88 percent of Americans support legalization for either recreational or medical use. And more than half of Americans state they have used marijuana, making enforcement even more arbitrary.    States have long been considered the “laboratories of democracy,” the federal government should follow the success of these states, and the will of the American people and deschedule marijuana. Federal descheduling will demonstrate leadership in helping clear the path for the remaining states to decriminalize marijuana, a crucial step in reducing the overcriminalization of Black and Brown people.  Thank you for considering my views, and again I urge you to update the proposed rule to deschedule marijuana.",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,0.9978062039841824
DEA-2024-0059-6346,2024-05-28T04:00Z,Dean Tandeski,"Government seems to have wanted a gateway drug, thus the reason they put a safe drug as scheduled 1.  If they lied about marijuana, surely they lied about all other scheduled 1 drugs or less scheduled drugs.  I don't think the U.S. government understands human behavior and how people are manipulated and motivated.  The term ""Gateway drug"" was caused by scheduling a passive, very safe drug like marijuana as a schedule 1 along with other very dangerous, correctly scheduled 1 drugs.  I have experienced marijuana for over 40 years.  I have found cannabis to be much more passive than alcohol.  Alcohol makes people more aggressive than cannabis.  The term ""Gateway Drug"" is a consequence of having marijuana a scheduled 1 drug.  Think about it, anyone that has tried marijuana did so knowing it was a scheduled 1 narcotic.  When we find out marijuana is not addictive, does not cause hallucinations, and only lasts a couple hours, the user begins to wonder why the government has lied to them? (did they corner the illicit market?)  If marijuana is a scheduled 1 narcotic and I have found the drug to be less harmful than alcohol, I most likely wonder if all other drugs scheduled 1 were also lied about and are not as dangerous or addicting as the U.S. government told us they were.  This is when the user tries heroin once and is hooked.  How can all other street drugs be scheduled less dangerous than marijuana?  Senseless!  

DEA needs to take marijuana off all schedules.  There is no reason to have alcohol legal if marijuana is considered schedule 1.  Ridiculous!   I have also seen the trusted law enforcement use marijuana as a reason to detain someone.   To fictitiously use marijuana to search for a crime. Cops are no longer helping people, it feels they are baiting people.  Accuse them of their car smelling like marijuana whether it did or didn't, before even telling them why they were stopped.  I have seen cops take the cannabis and let the guys go.   Cops use cannabis as a currency.  It is a bad temptation because cannabis is everywhere in today's culture. Cops have temptations also, having a popular spirits substance illegal and prevalent allows cops so much manipulation powers to the equation.  In addition, anyone that consumes cannabis every day, becomes immune to the use.  It relaxes the mood of a person but no longer gives them the feeling it once did.  The idea of treating marijuana usage laws similar to alcohol is automatically assuming marijuana is as dangerous as alcohol!?  Cannabis does not reduce your coordination and ability to think rationally like alcohol does.  That is a mistake!  That can be proved!  I challenge anyone to drink their 12 pack of beer and I will smoke a joint, eat a gummy, vape a pen, whatever.  We will then shoot free throws, play a basketball game, drive a car, shoot a gun, shoot a bow, ... Anything.  I guarantee you, the man that consumes cannabis will always beat the person in agility and thinking tests against anyone who drinks alcohol.  The problems today's government has, is today, the American people can more easily communicate with each other directly.  We the people, don't need to rely on the legacy news, an echo chamber for everything the U.S. government tells them.  Well my friends, today the world has changed.  The people are liberated with freedom of speech, expression and a common cell phone.  We have seen videos of bad cops.  Non users making the most popular SPIRITs substance illegal is not going to improve the citizens attitude towards the police and government.  It sure seems like the DEA has been profiting off of prohibition all these years.  Enough is enough!   The people have learned our government and DEA has lied to them.  The DEA has a conflict of interest.  To appove and to enforce is a direct conflict of interest.  That is like asking Tesla to make regulations and force regulations for the entire automobile industry.  No different.  DEA has too much power and its business of enforcement is to keep prohibition alive rather than to remove prohibition.  How will the DEA make up the revenue loss given to enforce prohibition?  How will the DEA make their fun money when cannabis users is no longer a large revenue generator?  If you want good relations between citizens and the police, end prohibition.  If 60-70% of people feel the cops are trying to arrest them using cannabis to entrap them, cannabis users will never improve their relationships or trust for a cop again.  Todays cops are trained to manipulate, trained to trick anyone they stop and ask questions.  Enforcing prohibition for a very mild drug has done more to hurt the police/civilian relationships than the drug has.  Why is the DEA so interested in arresting people that make choices that hurt no other person than maybe themselves.

DEA-2024-0059-39087,2024-07-22T04:00Z,George Garrett,"I am providing comments in support of the reclassification of botanical cannabis (Docket No. DEA–1362).

My grandson, who was addicted to drugs in high school here in WA State, stated that after WA State legalized the sale of cannabis and followed up with an aggressive program to close down illegal providers of marijuana, he stated that he personally witnessed the number of illegal drug dealers drop by approximately 50%.  And those drug dealers that remained, were left to peddle harder drugs such as meth, heroin and a variety of pills.  The DEA should recognize that consumption of cannabis exists in spite of the federal government's faux ban on marijuana, and that the health of citizens is harmed by providing money and cover to the illegal drug dealers that are peddling marijuana in addition to their other drugs.  The money earned by the underground network is linked to violence and is detrimental to the health of the population.   As regards to the overall benefits of marijuana, I'll discuss below.

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients.

This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether – thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states – I nonetheless do not oppose the factual basis underlying HHS’ recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower. It would be arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to reject HHS’s findings of fact and to maintain existing prohibitions of the cannabis plant.

Cannabis unquestionably does not meet the necessary criteria for either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. Cannabis does not belong in the same schedule as heroin and LSD, and is considerably safer than Schedule II substances such as fentanyl, methamphetamines, and oxycodone.

Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEA’s proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administration’s efforts to reconsider marijuana’s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it’s time to end this country’s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA’s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.

Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients’ access to medical marijuana. 

Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won’t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.

The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or “descheduling.” Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. 

Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana’s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. 

Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.

Given the Biden Administration’s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.

President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden’s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization.

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, AND tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis treatments. Federal policies and the large-scale clinical trials are needed to support the numerous studies providing credible evidence for the medical applications of cannabis.

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. ...14,000+ Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. 

The CDC reports that each year in the US, 178,000 die from excessive alcohol use, including 2,600+ deaths from alcohol poisoning. ...Suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are EXTREMELY rare. 

Reports exist of people developing ""a dependence on cannabis"", this is NO COMPARISON compared to Schedule II drugs and alcohol withdrawal —WHICH CAN BE FATAL. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensation, but FAR milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has INTENTIONALLY ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation.

DEA-2024-0059-26808,2024-07-03T04:00Z,Chris McAboy,"Cannabis Should Not Be a Schedule 1 Drug: A Perspective from Ten Years in the Industry

For the past decade, I have been deeply immersed in the cannabis industry, witnessing firsthand its profound impact on countless individuals. I have worked directly with customers and patients, held a medical marijuana certificate through our state's Department of Health, operated retail and medical cannabis dispensaries that have served over a million people, and witnessed the positive effects of medical cannabis usage within my own family members dealing with severe health issues. My experience has solidified my belief that cannabis should not be classified as a Schedule 1 drug. This designation, which deems cannabis as having no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse, is not only outdated but also detrimental to those who could benefit from its medicinal properties.

Cannabis has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in alleviating various medical conditions, both physical and mental. Patients suffering from chronic pain, for instance, often find traditional pharmaceuticals either ineffective or riddled with intolerable side effects. Cannabis, however, offers a natural alternative that many find more manageable and effective. I have seen patients who were bedridden with pain regain their mobility and quality of life after incorporating cannabis into their treatment regimen. The analgesic properties of cannabis, particularly those of cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) plus the numerous other cannabinoids and terpene profiles, provide a level of relief that often surpasses that of opioids, without the risk of addiction and overdose.

The mental health benefits of cannabis are equally compelling. I have encountered numerous individuals battling anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) who have found solace in cannabis. The anxiolytic and mood-stabilizing effects offer a safer alternative to conventional psychiatric medications, which can carry severe side effects and dependency issues. Veterans, in particular, have reported significant improvements in their PTSD symptoms with cannabis use, allowing them to reintegrate into society and rebuild their lives.

Moreover, the classification of cannabis as a Schedule 1 drug severely hampers scientific research. Researchers face numerous bureaucratic obstacles and limited funding opportunities, stifling the potential to uncover further therapeutic uses of cannabis. This restrictive status prevents the comprehensive clinical trials necessary to fully understand and harness the medicinal properties of cannabis. If reclassified, cannabis could be studied more extensively, leading to optimized treatments and potentially new pharmaceutical formulations that could benefit a wider range of patients.

The argument that cannabis has a high potential for abuse is also increasingly being challenged. While it is true that any substance can be misused, the potential for addiction and harm with cannabis is significantly lower than with many legal substances, such as alcohol, nicotine, and prescription opioids. Responsible regulation, education, and access to cannabis can mitigate risks, much like with other substances that are legally available yet regulated.

Furthermore, the societal and legal implications of maintaining cannabis as a Schedule 1 drug cannot be ignored. Criminalization disproportionately affects marginalized communities, contributing to cycles of poverty and incarceration. Decriminalizing and reclassifying cannabis would not only acknowledge its medical value but also address severe social justice issues by reducing the burden on the criminal justice system and allowing for more equitable access to its benefits.

In conclusion, my decade of experience in the cannabis industry has shown me the immense potential of this plant to improve lives. The current Schedule 1 classification is a barrier to medical progress and an injustice to those who could benefit from its therapeutic properties.

I am writing to express my support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. 



This is an important step toward a change in marijuana policy that addresses the decades-long discrimination against Black and Brown communities. 



Taking marijuana out of the same classification as more harmful substances like methamphetamine and heroin will give a huge boost to cannabis researchers and those in the cannabis business, and set the stage for further reparative measures for impacted communities. 



Reclassifying marijuana is a necessary step that will move the needle in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy and I urge you to pass this new rule and push back against this nation’s archaic laws against cannabis possession.

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.

I am providing comments in support of the reclassification of botanical cannabis (Docket No. DEA–1362).

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether – thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states – I nonetheless do not oppose the factual basis underlying HHS’ recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower. It would be arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to reject HHS’s findings of fact and to maintain existing prohibitions of the cannabis plant.

I am writing to express my strong support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. This is an important and necessary step towards modernizing our nation's drug policies, reflecting current scientific understanding of cannabis' potential benefits and harms.



For too long, marijuana has been categorized alongside highly dangerous substances like methamphetamine, despite mounting evidence suggesting its relative safety. Reclassifying it to Schedule III would not only acknowledge this reality but also pave the way for further research into its medicinal properties and potential risks.



Furthermore, reclassification would provide much-needed regulatory clarity for businesses operating within the burgeoning cannabis industry. The tax benefits that stand to accrue from such a move could stimulate economic growth and job creation in communities across America.



I urge you to consider these points as you review this critical proposal. Reclassifying marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act is a commonsense move that aligns with both public sentiment and scientific evidence. It represents another significant step forward in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy.



Thank you for your attention to this matter.

DEA-2024-0059-12759,2024-06-07T04:00Z,Raven McClellan,"I am writing to express considerations for the proposed rescheduling of marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III. As an MPH student, I recognize that the rescheduling of marijuana to a Schedule III drug has important public health implications on multiple environmental levels, like our physical environment and our social/ societal environments. Rescheduling marijuana may impact our physical environment through the changes that will happen with the way people grow and increase the cultivation of marijuana. The cultivation has an impact on our environment. Rescheduling marijuana offers the opportunity to research and regulate cultivation in a way that minimizes negative environmental public health outcomes. Rescheduling also has an impact on the societal level of our environment. Rescheduling brings forward the history of marijuana, and its relation to societal racism, and opens the floor to address the negative societal impacts like mass incarceration through the economic opportunities that will arise from rescheduling. 

Physical Environment.
The cultivation of marijuana can impact our physical environment through things like water use, pesticide use, and land use. Unsustainable water use for cultivation can deplete fresh water near cultivation sites and impact wildlife. Creating efficient water systems and incentivizing sustainable water practices may help mitigate the negative environmental impacts of marijuana cultivation. Pesticides control in growing marijuana should go past normal agriculture considering the pesticides used might be inhaled at high temperatures or ingested. Rescheduling marijuana may cause the expansion of cultivation. The usual location of cultivation has been in rural areas that are also environmentally sensitive. The regulations should incentivize the relocation of existing areas to agricultural land that is more suitable and ensure that new farms are not created in environmentally sensitive areas. These conditions should also prevent the cultivation from disproportionately impacting vulnerable populations in urban areas. 

Societal Environment.
Black people have been disproportionately impacted by the criminalization of marijuana. In Georgia, specifically, this is also the case. In 2022, though the use of marijuana nationally is comparable between Black (23.4%) and White (22.9%) populations (SAMHSA, 2024), there is a racial disparity within marijuana possession arrests. In Georgia, the arrest data reflects this disparity. In 2022, of all marijuana possession arrests (10612) Black people account for about 72% (7,651) of marijuana possession arrests while White people account for about 26% (2,764) of marijuana possession arrests in Georgia (FBI, 2024). The ACLU reported that in 2018 nationally, African Americans were 3.6 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people (Edwards et al., 2020). In Georgia, they found black people to be 3 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people (Edwards et al., 2020). The county with the highest racial disparity of marijuana possession arrests is Pickens County, GA where Black people are 97.2 times more likely to be arrested than White people (Edwards et al., 2020). 

With the rescheduling of marijuana comes a great societal and economic impact. The regulation and sale will result in profits that weren’t available before. Additionally, federal funding will be an option for use. With that comes a responsibility to use those funds equitably. Profits from the marijuana industry and federal funding should be allocated to fund research and health education efforts as well as supporting communities that have historically been disproportionately impacted by the criminalization of marijuana. Education programs should not only inform people of what the new ruling is and how it impacts them, but also educate people on marijuana, how it impacts their health, and best practices if they decide to use it. State-sponsored media programming similar to anti-tobacco activations may help prevent youth smoking (Colston et al., 2022). Additionally, the funding should be allocated towards programs that directly address the racial disparities that exist concerning the criminalization of marijuana. Supporting incarcerated individuals, and over-policed communities, and preventing discriminatory policing practices are imperative to addressing the racial disparities that exist.

As a member of the state-legal cannabis industry, I believe this change is a critical and long-overdue acknowledgment of the medical value of cannabis. This aligns with the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) recent recommendation to reclassify cannabis to Schedule III. However, rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and cannabinoid products should be properly regulated under a new federal regulatory pathway.

Removing marijuana from the CSA will ensure communities of color, disproportionately impacted by the war on drugs, are vindicated after years of bearing the stigma associated with racially motivated, cannabis related offenses. Moreover, it will open the door to more critical dialogue surrounding why and how we police Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) and communities, instead of safely and responsibly facilitating their access to the plant medicine they have historically relied upon.

Cannabis has had a broadly accepted medical value within the scientific community and to millions of Americans who use it under their physician's care and obtain it legally through state programs that exist in the vast majority of U.S. states. Additionally, the abuse potential of cannabis does not warrant its classification as a Schedule I substance, as it is far safer than legal products like alcohol and tobacco, by every possible measure. 

Reclassifying cannabis to Schedule III not only aligns federal law with current scientific understanding but also facilitates further research by removing some of the barriers associated with Schedule I classification. This step is essential in advancing medical science and expanding access to much-needed therapeutic options.

While the reclassification to Schedule III is a significant and positive step, it is important to recognize that it is only the beginning. The ultimate goal should be to treat intoxicating cannabis products in a manner similar to alcohol, with regulated legal sales for adults. 

Most Americans already live in a state that has made cannabis legal for adults and the only way to harmonize federal law with those states is to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act.  Doing so would not only provide consistency across states,  it would eliminate the illicit market and allow for the imposition of reasonable federal regulations to protect public health and safety.

In conclusion, reclassifying cannabis to Schedule III is a positive first step that acknowledges its medical value, supports state-regulated programs, and promotes public health and safety. While it is not the final goal, it sets the stage for future reforms that will ultimately lead to a legal and regulated cannabis market. I urge the Department of Justice and Drug Enforcement Administration to move forward with this reclassification and to work with other federal agencies to establish clear enforcement guidelines that respect state laws and support the cannabis industry.

I fully support reclassifying marijuana. I personally believe Schedule 3 is still too high but it is a step in the right direction. Marijuana and all related cannabinoids should be absolutely and completely legalized, decriminalized, and unscheduled. While the intoxicating portion of marijuana can cause a small bit of psychological dependence, it’s no more so than coffee or caffeine which is fully legal and sold nationwide!

With that said, I agree with changing it to a Schedule 3 substance even if I wish it was unscheduled completely. Schedule 3 will ease many of the restrictions placed on marijuana and people who use it medically. I have friends who work in places that drug test heavily and even though marijuana is legal to use medically in their state they could still be fired for failing a drug test for THC. 

Schedule 3 will also allow for us to further study the long term effects of marijuana without the extreme restrictions it currently has at a Schedule 1.

Keep in mind that a Schedule 1 drug has absolutely no medical use. When we look at a drug, such as heroin, we can see that it’s absolutely debilitating. It is a schedule 1 drug for a reason. It’s extremely addictive. It causes long term or lifetime dependence. It has a relatively high mortality rate. It has helped spur in the opoid epidemic. These are not what we see with marijuana use. With marijuana use we slight psychological dependence. Little to no mortality rate. Health benefits for many living with various illnesses.

Even compared with alcohol, marijuana is undoubtedly safer. 

So yes. Please reschedule to schedule 3 or if possible schedule 4 or unschedule it completely.

Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.

I am writing to express my strong support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. This is an important and necessary step towards modernizing our nation's drug policies, reflecting current scientific understanding of cannabis' potential benefits and harms.



For too long, marijuana has been categorized alongside highly dangerous substances like methamphetamine, despite mounting evidence suggesting its relative safety. Reclassifying it to Schedule III would not only acknowledge this reality but also pave the way for further research into its medicinal properties and potential risks.



Furthermore, reclassification would provide much-needed regulatory clarity for businesses operating within the burgeoning cannabis industry. The tax benefits that stand to accrue from such a move could stimulate economic growth and job creation in communities across America.



I urge you to consider these points as you review this critical proposal. Reclassifying marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act is a commonsense move that aligns with both public sentiment and scientific evidence. It represents another significant step forward in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy.

DEA-2024-0059-30678,2024-07-16T04:00Z,Donald Harland,"Dear Drug Enforcement Administration,
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the DEA’s proposed rule change, which would
reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). I
am writing to express my concerns with this proposed rule. While I appreciate the Administration’s
recognition that marijuana should be removed from Schedule I, this proposed rule falls short and
ultimately will not reduce the decades of damage caused by the criminalization of
marijuana. Furthermore, the proposed rule misses an opportunity to align federal policy with where
much of the country is headed, and is completely out of step with where most Americans are on this
issue. Rather than rescheduling, I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and instead issue a
rule that would completely deschedule marijuana from the CSA.
Marijuana was initially included in the CSA pending a study and review by the National Commission
on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, better known as the Shafer Commission, over 50 years ago. That
study concluded that marijuana was no more dangerous than alcohol and recommended that it be
decriminalized. Nixon rejected this recommendation, and his domestic policy chief was later quoted
as saying this decision was predicated on a desire to weaponize criminalization and the so called
“War on Drugs” to target Black and Brown people and anti-war protestors. He stated: “We could
arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on
the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course, we did.”
We know the devastation this “War on Drugs” has wreaked on Black and Brown communities. In all
50 states, Black people are more likely to be arrested for marijuana offenses than white people,
despite similar usage rates. On average across the nation, a Black person is nearly four times as
likely to be arrested for a marijuana offense than a white person. While often touted for its
liberalism, in New York City 94 percent of all people arrested for marijuana offenses are people of
color. The last 50 years has taught us that we cannot achieve racial justice so long as this “War on
Drugs” is allowed to rage.
In addition to the racial injustice linked to criminalizing marijuana, the continued criminalization of
marijuana is incredibly fiscally irresponsible. Forty percent of all drug arrests in the U.S. are for
marijuana offenses, overwhelmingly for simple possession. In fact, arrests for marijuana outnumber
arrests for all violent crimes combined. It is estimated that the U.S. spends upwards of $7.6 billion
annually on the criminalization of marijuana. Putting aside the real harms caused by
criminalization, this is an enormous amount of taxpayer money that could be put to far better use.
This money could be used to fund schools, mental health and substance abuse services, proper
nutrition for families, and youth programming. Missouri legalized marijuana in 2020, and it is
projected that by the end of 2024 it will have generated $238 million in tax revenue. The state uses
that money to fund drug treatment, veteran services, and other important social programs. In
another example, Colorado generated $1.6 billion in tax revenue within a six-year period to fund
schools, literacy programs, and mental health services.
Widespread acceptance of marijuana has increased tremendously in recent decades. Twenty-four
states have completely legalized recreational marijuana, and over half of Americans live in a state
where it is legal. Another 14 states have legalized the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes. In
one of the most obvious signs that legalization is working, not a single state has reversed its
legalization of marijuana. Furthermore, 88 percent of Americans support legalization for either
recreational or medical use. And more than half of Americans state they have used marijuana,
making enforcement even more arbitrary.
States have long been considered the “laboratories of democracy,” the federal government should
follow the success of these states, and the will of the American people and deschedule marijuana.
Federal descheduling will demonstrate leadership in helping clear the path for the remaining states
to decriminalize marijuana, a crucial step in reducing the over-criminalization of Black and Brown
people. Thank you for considering my views, and again I urge you to update the proposed rule to
deschedule marijuana.",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,0.9978062039841824

DEA-2024-0059-0288,2024-05-21T04:00Z,Anonymous,"Cannabis' placement on the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) has been widely criticized as unfair and driven by political and social, rather than scientific considerations. Cannabis should be unscheduled from the Controlled Substances Act altogether rather than being moved to Schedule III for several reasons.

Firstly, The decision to place cannabis on Schedule I was heavily influenced by propaganda campaigns such as ""Reefer Madness,"" which portrayed cannabis as a dangerous drug that caused madness, violence, and moral decay. These sensationalized depictions fueled public hysteria and provided a justification for harsh anti-cannabis laws.
During the 1970s, amidst the fervor of the ""War on Drugs,"" politicians and law enforcement officials seized upon these exaggerated claims to push for strict penalties and punitive measures against cannabis use. By associating cannabis with societal ills and deviant behavior, they sought to justify its classification alongside truly dangerous substances like heroin and LSD.
This political climate, fueled by fear-mongering and misinformation, led to the inclusion of cannabis as a Schedule I substance in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. Despite the lack of scientific evidence supporting its placement in this category, the demonization of cannabis prevailed, shaping decades of drug policy and perpetuating the stigmatization of cannabis users.

Secondly, Schedule I substances are deemed to have a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use, and a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision. However, there is ample evidence to suggest that cannabis does not meet these criteria. Numerous studies have demonstrated its potential medical benefits in treating various conditions such as chronic pain, epilepsy, and nausea, among others. 

In 2022 the HHS, was tasked by the Biden administration to review the federal designation of cannabis, based its conclusions, in part, upon the real-world experiences of over “30,000 health care practitioners authorized to recommend marijuana” under state law and the more than 6 million state-registered cannabis patients they serve. The HHS concludes that  “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.” Department officials also stated added, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as alcohol (which is unscheduled) or benzodiazepines, which are currently classified as a Schedule IV drug, a lower classification than the proposed Schedule III of cannabis.  

Thirdly, many states have already legalized medical cannabis, California was the first legalized medical marijuana state nearly 30 years ago. Since then 37 additional states have followed suit and made cannabis legal for medical patients. Also 24 states encompassing 53 percent of the entire U.S. population have legalized adult-use marijuana markets. Most of these statewide policy changes were enacted by voters at the ballot box. Seventy percent of Americans say that cannabis ought to be legal for those age 21 or older, and the majority agree that “alcohol is more harmful to a person’s health than marijuana.”

Unscheduling cannabis would allow for more effective harm reduction strategies and reduce conflicting state vs federal laws which cause confusion and complicated legal issues. Regulation should be tailored to its specific risks and benefits, policymakers could implement measures to ensure safe consumption, proper labeling, and age restrictions, similar to alcohol and tobacco.

Lastly,  the classification of cannabis as a Schedule III substance would continue stigmatization and hinder its acceptance as a legitimate form of medicine. Removing it from scheduling altogether would signal a shift towards viewing cannabis as a substance worthy of medical exploration and address the social justice aspect of the issue, rather than continuing to label it as a dangerous drug. The current and proposed scheduling disproportionately affects communities of color, leading to mass incarceration and perpetuating systemic inequalities. Unscheduling cannabis would be a step towards rectifying these injustices and promoting equity in the legal system.

In closing, unscheduling cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act entirely is the most sensible approach, as it would promote scientific research, reduce stigma, enable effective regulation, and address social justice concerns.

I am writing to express my support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. 



This is an important step toward a change in marijuana policy that addresses the decades-long discrimination against Black and Brown communities. 



Taking marijuana out of the same classification as more harmful substances like methamphetamine and heroin will give a huge boost to cannabis researchers and those in the cannabis business, and set the stage for further reparative measures for impacted communities. 



Reclassifying marijuana is a necessary step that will move the needle in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy and I urge you to pass this new rule and push back against this nation’s archaic laws against cannabis possession.

The Department of Health and Human Services reached the determination to reschedule cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”) to Schedule III of the CSA, as there is a clear and present understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of a myriad of significant conditions.
On the State level – more than 1/2 of all States in the U.S. have now fully legalized the production and sale of cannabis and related products, while 2/3 of all states have approved the medical regulation to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in medical programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. There is clear scientific evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs.
Additionally, the tax revenue opportunities have been massive for States that have fully legalized the plant. California, as one of the most mature legal markets, collected over $1 Billion in 2023 tax revenue. This is a HUGE revenue opportunity desperately needed at the federal level, considering the growing U.S. national debt is now almost up to $35 trillion.

It is also common knowledge that cannabis is much safer than many other controlled substances, and cannabis clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

In sum, cannabis clearly does not meet the required criteria to be classified as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. Personally, I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether, as the primary reason it was ever assigned a Schedule I classification in the first place was a politically driven move by the war on drugs in the 1970s, rather than based on any valid science. If the DEA were to reject HHS’s findings at this time and maintain existing prohibitions on cannabis, it would be a clear denial of the proven medical benefits that this miracle plant provides.",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,0.6034976538305868

I urge the Drug Enforcement Agency to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act, a move that would mark a step toward rectifying the harms caused by its criminalization.

This happened at the White House Conferences for a Drug Free America held during the Reagan administration. (I was invited as a member of the parent movement and was awarded a Certificate of Outstanding Contribution to the Conferences.)

The legitimate use of any drug is for a legitimate necessary medical purpose when drug free methods are ineffective to treat, cure or prevent disease or medical conditions.

The FDA’s responsibility is to approve drugs whether for prescription or over-the-counter which provide the best results and least negative side effects for the medical condition in question. This is done after the drug is put through the process of independent, blind clinical trials and independent peer reviews.

We have gone down the legality path so far that the general public now wants to  believe that drug use is to be considered “recreational” like hiking, hobbies, swimming, etc. Any society that considers drug use “recreational” is a sick society. 

Relaxing the restrictions on any drug whether cannabis or the next one … psychedelic mushrooms … will whitewash the negatives. 

A major educational push to change the dishonest and dangerous current message re drug use to one which pushes the responsible and accurate one of the legitimate, necessary, appropriate use for any drug is absolutely necessary. 

The role of government is to protect the health, safety and well being of its citizens. Making the public rethink its drug use would benefit the individual and the public especially when an individual’s drug use has secondhand effects as with alcohol, tobacco, cannabis and more.

Legalizing something harmful never removes the harm.  It just changes the legal consequences usually for those who promote, produce or in other ways profit financially from  the ""legalized"" substance or activity with little to no regard for the negative impact on individuals or society-at-large.

DEA-2024-0059-7985,2024-05-30T04:00Z,Ashley Farreny,"To Whom it May Concern:

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.

It is the reason I am opposing this rescheduling as this substance poses significant and well established risks, risks that are wholly underappreciated and understood by the broad public and users. Given this risk covers a wide segment of the population, and users and to-be-users THC should not be rescheduled and further more in all jurisdictions that have legal access all products should be administered under a REMS drug delivery system - for the best opportunity to educate, monitor and to collect data. The Surgeon General of the USA has stated that there is substantial evidence to support issuing a warning to of the risk of low birth weight of offspring born to women who use; low birth weight being a top   predictor of infant mortality. Use of marijuana by males is linked by the evidence of science to heightened risk of testicular cancer, sperm morphology, dna damage in offspring that may well prove to be generational, and a cause of spontaneous abortion and miscarriage. A review of the funding of marijuana studies on the NIH Reporter shows as of March 2024 there has been 11,092 studies related to cannabis at a cost of $4.6 BILLIONS ( just in the USA) and still zero medical FDA approved indications for cannabis.  It is clearly not a question of a need for more funding and more studies but rather a question of how much more of a mountain of evidence of harm does your agency need to realize that this substance will never in its plant form be determined a medicine, a substance that can be dosed, and all side effect interactions understood. What you are suggesting is the equivalent of allowing for the quackery of previous centuries to be the order of the day - where chewing on willow bark with all the contaminants and components is considered a medicine worth of the name. There is a false narrative being repeated across the nation and that is that changing the scheduling is a ""fair move"" as surely fentanyl is a more dangerous drug than cannabis - but in saying this the mistake is being made in thinking that marijuana is a medicine which it is not nor could it ever be under the terms of definition of modern medicine. Fentanyl has medicinal properties whereas cannabis does not. The derivatives of cannabis THC and CBD have been available through as Epidiolex, Sativex, and other isolated products and the side effect profiles and drug interactions have been studied and are documented as are their low efficacy rates for specific and rare conditions.  Government documents available online state the following warning: 
Cannabis should not be used if you:
Are under the age of 25
are allergic to any cannabinoid or to smoke
have serious liver, kidney, heart or lung disease
have a personal or family history of serious mental disorders such as schizophrenia, psychosis, depression, or bipolar disorder
are pregnant, are planning to get pregnant, or are breast-feeding
are a man who wishes to start a family
have a history of alcohol or drug abuse or substance dependence.

How could any responsible government participate in changing the scheduling to further confuse the public on the risks of marijuana use and allow a product with a risk profile such as the one associated with marijuana and without any FDA approved medicinal use ?

I am writing to register my opposition to the recommendation to move marijuana from Schedule 1 to Schedule 3 of the Controlled Substances Act. 

Rescheduling marijuana would allow the marijuana industry to begin deducting normal business expenses, including advertising and marketing expenses. This would make the industry enormously profitable and incentivize them to spend even more on advertising and marketing.  With this, we can expect marijuana sales to grow exponentially, and harms associated with marijuana use to rise in tandem. Big Tobacco taught us all too well the deleterious impact of advertising on youth: the more teens are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely they are to start smoking. The same will be true with marijuana. The marijuana industry will undoubtedly take a page out of Big Tobacco’s marketing playbook, making marijuana use look glamorous and benign with celebrity endorsements, candy flavoring (already seen in marijuana edibles), product placement in movies, and more. 

Perhaps most alarming: even without the expected deluge of ads and slick marketing, marijuana use is at an all-time high. Teen use of marijuana is at 30- year high, with more teens reporting smoking marijuana than tobacco. Among young adults 19 to 30, 26% used in the past month compared to 17% in 2011, and 11% were daily users, up from 6% in 2011. 

The recommendation from HHS failed to take into account actual/relative potential for abuse or harms associated with use. Contrary to popular narrative, marijuana can be addictive; In fact, as many as 1 in 3 past year marijuana users met the clinical criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder. People who self-medicate with marijuana are not exempt from becoming addicted to it. According to research at Massachusetts General Hospital, “using cannabis products to treat pain, anxiety and depression failed to improve these symptoms while doubling the risk of developing the addictive symptoms of cannabis use disorder.” 

With the exception of one study of medical marijuana patients in Maryland, the review from HHS failed to acknowledge or consider the link between marijuana and psychosis. This is especially concerning in light of the rising potency of marijuana. Daily users of marijuana over 10% THC are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than non-users. A 2023 study in Denmark determined that 30 percent of cases of schizophrenia among 21–30-year-old males could have been averted if cannabis use disorder had been prevented. A 2022 study found that hospital discharges for marijuana-associated psychosis were higher in states with legal marijuana, another precursor if those who push full-scale commercialization have their way. 

Marijuana use is especially concerning in young people, a factor HHS failed to adequately address. The National Center for Education Statistics said, “adolescent marijuana use has been associated with lower academic performance and a higher risk of dropping out of high school.”  Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, warns, “Youth who use marijuana regularly are more likely to have a hard time learning, problems remembering, and lower math and reading scores. These effects can last weeks after the last time they used marijuana.” Recognizing that much remains unknown about marijuana, NIDA noted, “researchers are still studying how long marijuana’s effects last and whether some changes may be permanent.” 

Finally, while some states recognize “medical marijuana” there is, in fact, no currently accepted medical use. Unlike other drugs in Schedule III, marijuana is not FDA approved to treat or cure any disease and it is not available for prescription in any state. In 2023, the American Medical Association adopted a position statement that “encourages hospitals and health systems to: (a) not recommend patient use of non-FDA approved cannabis or cannabis-derived products within healthcare facilities until such time as federal laws or regulations permit its use; and (b) educate medical staffs on cannabis use, effects and cannabis withdrawal syndrome.”

I am writing to express my strong support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. This is an important and necessary step towards modernizing our nation's drug policies, reflecting current scientific understanding of cannabis' potential benefits and harms.



For too long, marijuana has been categorized alongside highly dangerous substances like methamphetamine, despite mounting evidence suggesting its relative safety. Reclassifying it to Schedule III would not only acknowledge this reality but also pave the way for further research into its medicinal properties and potential risks.



Furthermore, reclassification would provide much-needed regulatory clarity for businesses operating within the burgeoning cannabis industry. The tax benefits that stand to accrue from such a move could stimulate economic growth and job creation in communities across America.



I urge you to consider these points as you review this critical proposal. Reclassifying marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act is a commonsense move that aligns with both public sentiment and scientific evidence. It represents another significant step forward in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy.

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

I urge the Drug Enforcement Agency to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act, a move that would mark a step toward rectifying the harms caused by its criminalization. 

By descheduling cannabis, the federal government would be following the lead of 31 states that have already decriminalized the drug. In fact, the majority of people in the U.S.—70 percent, according to a November 2023 Gallup poll—support cannabis legalization. 

But rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, as the Department of Health & Human Services and the DEA have proposed, is insufficient. If cannabis remains on the CSA, people can continue to face penalties at the federal level for possession, including arrest and incarceration, which lead to a lifetime of consequences that impact someone’s ability to secure employment, housing, public benefits, educational opportunities, and more. 

The criminalization of cannabis—a legacy of the War on Drugs—was a policy decision rooted in racism. In the decades since, its enforcement has been disproportionately targeted at Black people and other people of color. It’s time to abandon this draconian approach. I support descheduling cannabis from the CSA—a step toward righting the wrongs of its criminalization. There are provably so many more dangerous drugs to put our focus on. Free up the resources wasted on the criminalization of a plant and redirect those resources toward the plethora of opiates, amphetamines and the various refined and truly dangerous drugs that are readily available on our streets and in our neighborhoods, in part because you waste your time and our tax dollars on a plant.",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,0.8287288148504464

I am 66 years old and the full time caregiver for my  94 year old father with dementia. I suffer from chronic pain due to a variety of diseases (degenerative spine, arthritis, sciatica). The use of cannabis helps to reduce my pain, relaxes my anxiety, and helps me to sleep better. Unfortunately, at this time I must purchase this illegally from unknown sources, and I  break the law every time I do so just to help with my pain. 

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

As the Chief law enforcement agency in Tennessee with significant responsibility for combating illicit and dangerous drug use, TBI has an important interest in this rescheduling.  TBI's opposition is grounded in concerns about public safety, public health, social consequences, and the deviation from the longstanding established procedure of the rescheduling process.  Indeed, even while proposing reclassification, the Department concedes that the ""abuse of marijuana produces clear evidence of harmful consequences"" and its consumption creates a ""risk to public health.""

Here, the proposed rule is invalid because it relies on an Eight Factor Analysis (8FA) that was performed by the Attorney General rather than the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).  Because the Attorney General has delegated scheduling authority to DEA, he cannot exercise that authority while the delegation is in effect.

DEA-2024-0059-7700,2024-05-29T04:00Z,Angelo Veltri,"I am writing to you today to urge the Drug Enforcement Administration to reconsider the current scheduling of cannabis under the Controlled Substances Act. As a concerned citizen, I believe it is crucial for the DEA to reschedule cannabis from its current classification as a Schedule I substance to a more appropriate category that reflects its medical value and lower potential for abuse compared to other controlled substances.

Cannabis is currently classified alongside heroin and LSD under Schedule I, which indicates a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. However, this classification is increasingly at odds with both scientific research and the evolving legal landscape across the United States. Numerous studies have demonstrated the therapeutic benefits of cannabis for a variety of medical conditions, including chronic pain, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and cancer-related symptoms. Furthermore, 38 states, along with the District of Columbia, have enacted laws allowing medical cannabis use, recognizing its value in patient care.

The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine conducted a comprehensive review of over 10,000 scientific abstracts and concluded that there is substantial evidence supporting the use of cannabis for chronic pain, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and multiple sclerosis spasticity symptoms. Ignoring these findings by maintaining cannabis as a Schedule I substance not only undermines scientific integrity but also restricts access to a potentially life-changing treatment for countless patients.

Moreover, the current scheduling of cannabis imposes significant barriers to further research. Researchers face onerous regulatory hurdles that stymie the advancement of our understanding of cannabis and its effects. Rescheduling cannabis would facilitate more robust scientific studies, ultimately leading to more informed public health policies and medical practices.

In addition to the medical and scientific reasons for rescheduling, there are significant social justice implications. The enforcement of cannabis prohibition has disproportionately impacted minority communities, contributing to systemic inequalities in the criminal justice system. Rescheduling cannabis could be a step towards rectifying these injustices, reducing the burden on the criminal justice system, and focusing law enforcement resources on more pressing public safety concerns.

The rescheduling of cannabis is supported by a broad coalition of stakeholders, including medical professionals, scientists, patients, and lawmakers. The American Medical Association, the American College of Physicians, and the American Public Health Association have all called for a review of cannabis’s Schedule I status. Public opinion also strongly favors cannabis reform, with a significant majority of Americans supporting medical and recreational legalization.

In light of the substantial evidence supporting the medical use of cannabis, the need for further research, and the social justice implications, I urge the DEA to take immediate action to reschedule cannabis. Doing so would align federal policy with current scientific understanding and state-level reforms, ultimately benefiting public health, patient care, and social equity.

Thank you for considering this important matter. I hope the DEA will act swiftly to reclassify cannabis in a manner that reflects its medical value and potential for responsible use.",Supports,0.3904594539784234

I am writing to express my strong support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. This is an important and necessary step towards modernizing our nation's drug policies, reflecting current scientific understanding of cannabis' potential benefits and harms.



For too long, marijuana has been categorized alongside highly dangerous substances like methamphetamine, despite mounting evidence suggesting its relative safety. Reclassifying it to Schedule III would not only acknowledge this reality but also pave the way for further research into its medicinal properties and potential risks.



Furthermore, reclassification would provide much-needed regulatory clarity for businesses operating within the burgeoning cannabis industry. The tax benefits that stand to accrue from such a move could stimulate economic growth and job creation in communities across America.



I urge you to consider these points as you review this critical proposal. Reclassifying marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act is a commonsense move that aligns with both public sentiment and scientific evidence. It represents another significant step forward in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy.

I am providing comments in support of the reclassification of botanical cannabis (Docket No. DEA–1362).

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether – thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states – I nonetheless do not oppose the factual basis underlying HHS’ recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower.

I urge the Drug Enforcement Agency to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act, a move that would mark a step toward rectifying the harms caused by its criminalization.  

So many wasted lives over this issue.  It's really a pity that people are in jail for having this on their body when searched.  Once in jail, it's difficult to find a job and to rent.

By descheduling cannabis, the federal government would be following the lead of 31 states that have already decriminalized the drug. In fact, the majority of people in the U.S.—70 percent, according to a November 2023 Gallup poll—support cannabis legalization. 

But rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, as the Department of Health & Human Services and the DEA have proposed, is insufficient. If cannabis remains on the CSA, people can continue to face penalties at the federal level for possession, including arrest and incarceration, which lead to a lifetime of consequences that impact someone’s ability to secure employment, housing, public benefits, educational opportunities, and more. 

The criminalization of cannabis—a legacy of the War on Drugs—was a policy decision rooted in racism. In the decades since, its enforcement has been disproportionately targeted at Black people and other people of color. It’s time to abandon this draconian approach.

DEA-2024-0059-7336,2024-05-29T04:00Z,Tracey Katsouros,"To Whom it May Concern:

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

Enough already. It’s time to stop ruining people’s lives over this. Not to mention all the medicinal applications that can now be studied and used to help people. 

Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.

I have seen young adults in a psychotic crisis brought on by the use of marijuana. I have cared for individuals who were in horrific car accidents while under the influence of marijuana. Not all survived.  I have also seen the negative effects of what normalizing a high-risk substance (opioids) can do to our communities and our nation.  We have been fighting that epidemic for over a decade now.  

We are a data driven world. Let's learn from the data, the science, and our past history with addictive substances so we don't repeat our mistakes from the past!

I am writing to register my opposition to the recommendation to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. 

Rescheduling marijuana would allow the marijuana industry to deduct normal business expenses, including advertising and marketing expenses. This would make the industry profitable and incentivize them to spend even more on advertising and marketing.  This would likely cause marijuana sales and the harms associated with marijuana use to rise in tandem. Big Tobacco taught us the deleterious impact of advertising on youth: the more teens are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely they are to start smoking. The same will be true with marijuana. The marijuana industry will undoubtedly take a page out of Big Tobacco’s marketing playbook, making marijuana use look glamorous and benign with celebrity endorsements, candy flavoring (already seen in marijuana edibles), product placement in movies, and more. Even without the expected deluge of ads and marketing, marijuana use is at an all-time high. Teen use of marijuana is at 30- year high, with more teens reporting smoking marijuana than tobacco. Among young adults 19 to 30, 26% used in the past month compared to 17% in 2011, and 11% were daily users, up from 6% in 2011. 

HHS' recommendation failed to account for actual/relative potential for abuse or harms associated with use. Contrary to popular narrative, marijuana can be addictive. In fact, as many as 1 in 3 past year marijuana users met the clinical criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder. People who self-medicate with marijuana are not exempt from becoming addicted. According to research at Massachusetts General Hospital, “using cannabis products to treat pain, anxiety and depression failed to improve these symptoms while doubling the risk of developing the addictive symptoms of cannabis use disorder.” 

With the exception of one study of medical marijuana patients in Maryland, the review from HHS failed to acknowledge or consider the link between marijuana and psychosis. This is especially concerning in light of the rising potency of marijuana. Daily users of marijuana over 10% THC are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than non-users. A 2023 study in Denmark determined that 30% of cases of schizophrenia among 21–30-year-old males could have been averted if cannabis use disorder had been prevented. A 2022 study found that hospital discharges for marijuana-associated psychosis were higher in states with legal marijuana, another precursor if those who push full-scale commercialization have their way. 

Marijuana use is especially concerning in young people, a factor HHS failed to adequately address. The National Center for Education Statistics said, “adolescent marijuana use has been associated with lower academic performance and a higher risk of dropping out of high school.”  Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, warns, “Youth who use marijuana regularly are more likely to have a hard time learning, problems remembering, and lower math and reading scores. These effects can last weeks after the last time they used marijuana.” Recognizing that much remains unknown about marijuana, NIDA noted, “researchers are still studying how long marijuana’s effects last and whether some changes may be permanent.” 

Finally, while some states recognize “medical marijuana” there is no currently accepted medical use. Unlike other drugs in Schedule III, marijuana is not FDA approved to treat or cure any disease and it is not available for prescription in any state. In 2023, the American Medical Association adopted a position statement that “encourages hospitals and health systems to: (a) not recommend patient use of non-FDA approved cannabis or cannabis-derived products within healthcare facilities until such time as federal laws or regulations permit its use; and (b) educate medical staffs on cannabis use, effects and cannabis withdrawal syndrome.”

As an American citizen, I feel it should be rescheduled and left to the States to regulate, with the Federal government creating basic guidelines for interstate commerce and ensuring a prosperous domestic market (prohibiting imports).

The idea and concept behind Schedule I was for the most dangerous and harmful drugs. Instead, Schedule I has been abused politically by individuals seeking to harm minorities in our communities and limit people to only harmful pharmaceuticals when Cannabis continues to show promise for people. As such, it has devalued Schedule I to those who consume drugs looking for highs and harms the exact efforts of the DEA and others to try and encourage people to avoid them. 

For me, Cannabis has done wonders not only for my anxiety but allows my body to calm down when other medications don't work or have significant side effects. Cannabis causes far less harm to my body than Alcohol or other legal substances that are far easier to get. It allows my husband, who suffers from ADHD, the ability to feel their feelings when the drugs currently on the market suppress them. 

For my father, who has cancer, it has given him relief and has brought him a new perspective on just how harmful the war on drugs has been.

Recreationally, seeing people be able to consume it to unwind instead of alcohol has been refreshing and has made spaces more enjoyable than the often anger you see from people who consume too much alcohol. Especially drinks containing THC that allow people to be social. It is helping heal the ""third place"", a critical part of our social fabric that has been falling apart which contributes to people feeling alone, and isolated. As mental health is increasingly important, the benefit here cannot be underscored and should be considered. Especially as we have divides within our Country that have made it hard to talk to one another, this can help break the cycle, and get people to once again talk more respectively to one another, which can then reduce social tension. It's a feedback loop of sorts that only escalates without intervention, and Cannabis is that intervention.

Schedule III would only cause more complications for an industry that has been making efforts to comply with State laws while adding the DEA and FDA, who have clearly stated they don't have appropriate standards, resources, or ability to regulate Cannabis effectively. 

It's time to right the wrongs committed decades ago, and this would be a step in the right direction. Do the right thing, go further, and deschedule Cannabis.

DEA-2024-0059-24082,2024-06-22T04:00Z,Anonymous,Clearly cannabis has medicinal value and does not create a physical addiction like opiates or some of its companions on the most restrictive schedule possible. Our children should not be receiving sentences with serious future consequences for possession of a plant and its flowers. Now the necessary research can begin in earnest. The fact that this has taken so long and full legalization isn’t on the table is due to drug war politics.

DEA-2024-0059-1791,2024-05-23T04:00Z,Twyla Koch,"Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEA’s proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administration’s efforts to reconsider marijuana’s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it’s time to end this country’s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA’s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.

Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients’ access to medical marijuana. 

Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won’t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.

The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or “descheduling.” Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. 

Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana’s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. 

Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.

Given the Biden Administration’s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.

President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden’s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.

P.S. 
Alcohol is not even scheduled yet has proven to be more dangerous than Cannabis and is physically addictive unlike Cannabis henceforth makes more sense to deschedule because in the end Schedule III is still harsh considering those facts.

I am writing to express my strong support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. This is an important and necessary step towards modernizing our nation's drug policies, reflecting current scientific understanding of cannabis' potential benefits and harms.



For too long, marijuana has been categorized alongside highly dangerous substances like methamphetamine, despite mounting evidence suggesting its relative safety. Reclassifying it to Schedule III would not only acknowledge this reality but also pave the way for further research into its medicinal properties and potential risks.



Furthermore, reclassification would provide much-needed regulatory clarity for businesses operating within the burgeoning cannabis industry. The tax benefits that stand to accrue from such a move could stimulate economic growth and job creation in communities across America.



I urge you to consider these points as you review this critical proposal. Reclassifying marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act is a commonsense move that aligns with both public sentiment and scientific evidence. It represents another significant step forward in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy.

DEA-2024-0059-8514,2024-05-31T04:00Z,Sherwick Min,"I am providing comments in support of the reclassification of botanical cannabis (Docket No. DEA–1362). My personal feelings are based on my understanding of it from a data-driven perspective as well as how this appears to the rest of the world. I am an advisor of public and private sector companies and while speaking with an international client, I learned that everyone else believes America has ""NO culture"". In other words, inconsistent legal systems and cultural norms across our 50 states means to others that we have no consensus - no culture. This is not good. We can do much to change this public opinion in addition to making the lives of our citizens better and less confusing.

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether – thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states – I nonetheless do not oppose the factual basis underlying HHS’ recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower. It would be arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to reject HHS’s findings of fact and to maintain existing prohibitions of the cannabis plant.",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,0.8552214740557352

But rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, as the Department of Health & Human Services and the DEA have proposed, is insufficient. If cannabis remains on the CSA, people can continue to face penalties at the federal level for possession, including arrest and incarceration, which lead to a lifetime of consequences that impact someone’s ability to secure employment, housing, public benefits, educational opportunities, and more.

DEA-2024-0059-10718,2024-06-03T04:00Z,Christopher Nye,"This is a particularly bad time to move marijuana from Schedule i to 3. This was the consensus of 15 researchers and substance abuse professionals at a recent virtual convening to discuss cannabis in the U.S. In our discussion it became clear that as perception of risk has declined, use has increased greatly. A massive education on this subject is needed, and time is needed for truth to catch up.

I am writing to register my opposition to the recommendation to move marijuana from Schedule 1 to Schedule 3 of the Controlled Substances Act. 

Rescheduling marijuana would allow the marijuana industry to begin deducting normal business expenses, including advertising and marketing expenses. This would make the industry enormously profitable and incentivize them to spend even more on advertising and marketing.  With this, we can expect marijuana sales to grow exponentially, and harms associated with marijuana use to rise in tandem. Big Tobacco taught us all too well the deleterious impact of advertising on youth: the more teens are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely they are to start smoking. The same will be true with marijuana. The marijuana industry will undoubtedly take a page out of Big Tobacco’s marketing playbook, making marijuana use look glamorous and benign with celebrity endorsements, candy flavoring (already seen in marijuana edibles), product placement in movies, and more. 

Perhaps most alarming: even without the expected deluge of ads and slick marketing, marijuana use is at an all-time high. Teen use of marijuana is at 30- year high, with more teens reporting smoking marijuana than tobacco. Among young adults 19 to 30, 26% used in the past month compared to 17% in 2011, and 11% were daily users, up from 6% in 2011. 

The recommendation from HHS failed to take into account actual/relative potential for abuse or harms associated with use. Contrary to popular narrative, marijuana can be addictive; In fact, as many as 1 in 3 past year marijuana users met the clinical criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder. People who self-medicate with marijuana are not exempt from becoming addicted to it. According to research at Massachusetts General Hospital, “using cannabis products to treat pain, anxiety and depression failed to improve these symptoms while doubling the risk of developing the addictive symptoms of cannabis use disorder.” 

With the exception of one study of medical marijuana patients in Maryland, the review from HHS failed to acknowledge or consider the link between marijuana and psychosis. This is especially concerning in light of the rising potency of marijuana. Daily users of marijuana over 10% THC are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than non-users. A 2023 study in Denmark determined that 30 percent of cases of schizophrenia among 21–30-year-old males could have been averted if cannabis use disorder had been prevented. A 2022 study found that hospital discharges for marijuana-associated psychosis were higher in states with legal marijuana, another precursor if those who push full-scale commercialization have their way. 

Marijuana use is especially concerning in young people, a factor HHS failed to adequately address. The National Center for Education Statistics said, “adolescent marijuana use has been associated with lower academic performance and a higher risk of dropping out of high school.”  Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, warns, “Youth who use marijuana regularly are more likely to have a hard time learning, problems remembering, and lower math and reading scores.

DEA-2024-0059-9443,2024-05-31T04:00Z,Tom Fischlin,"I am providing comments in support of the reclassification of botanical cannabis (Docket No. DEA–1362).

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether – thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states – I nonetheless do not oppose the factual basis underlying HHS’ recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower. It would be arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to reject HHS’s findings of fact and to maintain existing prohibitions of the cannabis plant.

Please look into how cannabis got into the CSA. They knew it was wrong but they did it anyway. It became a weapon against the hippies that Nixon didn't like. They even formed a committee which found that cannabis did not belong in the CSA. Then they ignored those findings. We have been stuck with those lies for fifty years. Please take this opportunity to end this madness. It can be regulated like alcohol and tobacco. 
I have been using cannabis for years to alleviate my chronic knee pain with no adverse problems. It really helps!

DEA-2024-0059-17581,2024-06-14T04:00Z,Sidney DeMello Gilfillan,"My service disabled veteran spouse began self medicating with cannabis and abandoned his family of 8 experiencing a life destroying episode of Bupolar mania onset by cannabis. Cannabis is not harmless. My 6 kids have not seen or spoken to their veteran military officer in 1.5 years. Shame on anyone who passes this addiction for profit scam.

I am writing to register my opposition to the recommendation to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. 

Rescheduling marijuana would allow the marijuana industry to deduct normal business expenses, including advertising and marketing expenses. This would make the industry profitable and incentivize them to spend even more on advertising and marketing.  This would likely cause marijuana sales and the harms associated with marijuana use to rise in tandem. Big Tobacco taught us the deleterious impact of advertising on youth: the more teens are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely they are to start smoking. The same will be true with marijuana. The marijuana industry will undoubtedly take a page out of Big Tobacco’s marketing playbook, making marijuana use look glamorous and benign with celebrity endorsements, candy flavoring (already seen in marijuana edibles), product placement in movies, and more. Even without the expected deluge of ads and marketing, marijuana use is at an all-time high. Teen use of marijuana is at 30- year high, with more teens reporting smoking marijuana than tobacco. Among young adults 19 to 30, 26% used in the past month compared to 17% in 2011, and 11% were daily users, up from 6% in 2011. 

HHS' recommendation failed to account for actual/relative potential for abuse or harms associated with use. Contrary to popular narrative, marijuana can be addictive. In fact, as many as 1 in 3 past year marijuana users met the clinical criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder. People who self-medicate with marijuana are not exempt from becoming addicted. According to research at Massachusetts General Hospital, “using cannabis products to treat pain, anxiety and depression failed to improve these symptoms while doubling the risk of developing the addictive symptoms of cannabis use disorder.” 

With the exception of one study of medical marijuana patients in Maryland, the review from HHS failed to acknowledge or consider the link between marijuana and psychosis. This is especially concerning in light of the rising potency of marijuana. Daily users of marijuana over 10% THC are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than non-users. A 2023 study in Denmark determined that 30% of cases of schizophrenia among 21–30-year-old males could have been averted if cannabis use disorder had been prevented. A 2022 study found that hospital discharges for marijuana-associated psychosis were higher in states with legal marijuana, another precursor if those who push full-scale commercialization have their way. 

Marijuana use is especially concerning in young people, a factor HHS failed to adequately address. The National Center for Education Statistics said, “adolescent marijuana use has been associated with lower academic performance and a higher risk of dropping out of high school.”  Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, warns, “Youth who use marijuana regularly are more likely to have a hard time learning, problems remembering, and lower math and reading scores. These effects can last weeks after the last time they used marijuana.” Recognizing that much remains unknown about marijuana, NIDA noted, “researchers are still studying how long marijuana’s effects last and whether some changes may be permanent.” 

Finally, while some states recognize “medical marijuana” there is no currently accepted medical use. Unlike other drugs in Schedule III, marijuana is not FDA approved to treat or cure any disease and it is not available for prescription in any state. In 2023, the American Medical Association adopted a position statement that “encourages hospitals and health systems to: (a) not recommend patient use of non-FDA approved cannabis or cannabis-derived products within healthcare facilities until such time as federal laws or regulations permit its use; and (b) educate medical staffs on cannabis use, effects and cannabis withdrawal syndrome.”

I am writing to express my strong support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. This is an important and necessary step towards modernizing our nation's drug policies, reflecting current scientific understanding of cannabis' potential benefits and harms.



For too long, marijuana has been categorized alongside highly dangerous substances like methamphetamine, despite mounting evidence suggesting its relative safety. Reclassifying it to Schedule III would not only acknowledge this reality but also pave the way for further research into its medicinal properties and potential risks.



Furthermore, reclassification would provide much-needed regulatory clarity for businesses operating within the burgeoning cannabis industry. The tax benefits that stand to accrue from such a move could stimulate economic growth and job creation in communities across America.



I urge you to consider these points as you review this critical proposal. Reclassifying marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act is a commonsense move that aligns with both public sentiment and scientific evidence. It represents another significant step forward in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy.

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value.

You might think you're the same individual after three drinks, but you're not. No matter how well you handle your liquor.  

Alcohol kills people on a daily basis. Diseases associated with and not limited to mental health. Cirrhosis and everything else that alcohol damages. 

Cannabis has been proven to be non-lethal and almost impossible to overdose. The odds of dying due to cannabis intake are rare. 

Alcohol doesn't help relieve cancer or have any medicinal factors? 

Cannabis helps people like me or recovered alcoholic who suffers mental health issues and utilizes cannabis instead of Xanax. 

It's been a very long time that you guys have scrutinized the legitimacy of this plant. It was so taboo when I was 16 years old in the '90s. 

Nobody should feel as bad as I did simply for enjoying what I considered a recreational medicine for myself. 

I don't believe you can find anyone who would call alcohol medicinal for any reason unless they were habitually addicted. 

Please. You guys are so far behind. If there's going to be a war on drugs it can't be on this plant. It needs to be on fentanyl, heroin and cocaine. 

With this becoming legal, you'll be able to focus all of your efforts elsewhere. You won't even have to think about cannabis. It won't even be on the docket. And innocent people like myself won't feel paranoid or guilty or like they're doing something wrong. 

Because I know if I were to pick up a drink that would be the end of my life as I know it. 

In essence, cannabis saves life.

I am writing to express my strong support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. This is an important and necessary step towards modernizing our nation's drug policies, reflecting current scientific understanding of cannabis' potential benefits and harms.



For too long, marijuana has been categorized alongside highly dangerous substances like methamphetamine, despite mounting evidence suggesting its relative safety. Reclassifying it to Schedule III would not only acknowledge this reality but also pave the way for further research into its medicinal properties and potential risks.



Furthermore, reclassification would provide much-needed regulatory clarity for businesses operating within the burgeoning cannabis industry. The tax benefits that stand to accrue from such a move could stimulate economic growth and job creation in communities across America.



I urge you to consider these points as you review this critical proposal. Reclassifying marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act is a commonsense move that aligns with both public sentiment and scientific evidence. It represents another significant step forward in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy.

DEA-2024-0059-41790,2024-07-23T04:00Z,LAURA SWOGER,"Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEA’s proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administration’s efforts to reconsider marijuana’s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it’s time to end this country’s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA’s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.

Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients’ access to medical marijuana. 

Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won’t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.

The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or “descheduling.” Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. 

Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana’s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. 

Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.

Given the Biden Administration’s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.

President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden’s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.

I am writing to express my support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. 



This is an important step toward a change in marijuana policy that addresses the decades-long discrimination against Black and Brown communities. 



Taking marijuana out of the same classification as more harmful substances like methamphetamine and heroin will give a huge boost to cannabis researchers and those in the cannabis business, and set the stage for further reparative measures for impacted communities. 



Reclassifying marijuana is a necessary step that will move the needle in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy and I urge you to pass this new rule and push back against this nation’s archaic laws against cannabis possession.

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

It is ridiculous that this natural plant, with a plethora of benefits, has been restricted for both medical and recreational use for so long. The fact that is currently scheduled similar to very hard drugs is appalling. This should be treated more similar to alcohol and tobacco. As free Americans we should be allowed to grow, smoke, buy, and sell marijuana. It is clear legalizing marijuana would benefit Americans currently incarcerated, or who have bad records, medical patients, or even just Americans that want to relax.  Current drug laws also are selectively applied, and more heavily impact POC or poor communities, even without intentional bias. It is also evident marijuana is no more harmful, maybe even healthier, than alcohol or tobacco which are currently accepted and marketed at alarming rates comparatively. The number of angry drunks outweighs dangerous potheads for example. I know of many occasions where people get aggressive or do stupid things while drinking, the worst thing that happens when most people smoke too much weed is them eating too many Doritos or taking a nice nap.

While this is a baby step in the right direction, does anyone who has been paying attention over the last 50+ years seriously believe cannabis is  anywhere near as dangerous or problematic as ketamine or codeine?  
Every major study - from NY Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia's Commissions Academy report in 1938 to Richard Nixon's ""blue ribbon"" report in 1972, and beyond, have come to pro-legalization conclusions that differ markedly from the DEA's rigid paralysis on the issue.

Dear Administrator,

I am writing to urge the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to reconsider the classification of cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act. This classification, which places cannabis alongside the most dangerous drugs with no accepted medical use, is both scientifically outdated and detrimental to public health. Specifically, I would like to highlight the substantial body of evidence demonstrating the therapeutic benefits of cannabis for children with special needs, particularly those suffering from epilepsy and pediatric hypertension.

Therapeutic Benefits for Children with Epilepsy
Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures, which can significantly impair a child's quality of life. Traditional antiepileptic drugs often fail to provide adequate seizure control and can have severe side effects. In contrast, numerous studies have documented the efficacy of cannabis, particularly cannabidiol (CBD), in reducing seizure frequency and severity in children with epilepsy.

Clinical Evidence:

Charlotte Figi Case: Perhaps the most well-known case is that of Charlotte Figi, a young girl with Dravet syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy. After exhausting all other treatment options, Charlotte's parents turned to CBD oil. The results were remarkable, with Charlotte experiencing a dramatic reduction in seizures from 300 per week to just a few per month.

Clinical Trials: A 2017 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that CBD significantly reduced seizure frequency in patients with Dravet syndrome. The study showed a median reduction in seizures of 39% in the CBD group compared to 13% in the placebo group.

FDA Approval: The therapeutic potential of CBD was recognized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2018 with the approval of Epidiolex, a CBD-based medication, for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome.

Therapeutic Benefits for Children with Pediatric Hypertension
Pediatric hypertension is a growing concern, often associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases later in life. Current treatment options can be limited and may carry significant side effects. Emerging research suggests that cannabis, particularly its cannabinoids, may offer novel therapeutic avenues for managing pediatric hypertension.

Clinical Evidence:

Vasodilation Properties: Cannabinoids such as CBD have been shown to possess vasodilatory properties, which can help reduce blood pressure. A study published in JCI Insight in 2017 demonstrated that a single dose of CBD reduced resting blood pressure and the blood pressure response to stress in healthy volunteers.

Anti-inflammatory Effects: Inflammation is a contributing factor to hypertension. CBD's anti-inflammatory effects can help mitigate this underlying issue, thereby aiding in the management of hypertension.

Reevaluation of Schedule I Classification
The classification of cannabis as a Schedule I substance implies that it has no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. However, the aforementioned evidence, along with the growing acceptance of medical cannabis by healthcare professionals and regulatory bodies, clearly contradicts this outdated perception. Reclassifying cannabis would facilitate much-needed research, improve access for patients in need, and align federal regulations with current scientific understanding.

Conclusion
In light of the compelling evidence supporting the medical use of cannabis for conditions such as epilepsy and pediatric hypertension, I respectfully urge the DEA to reconsider the Schedule I classification of cannabis. Reclassifying cannabis will not only reflect the current scientific consensus but also provide children with special needs access to safe and effective treatments that can dramatically improve their quality of life.

Thank you for considering this important matter. I look forward to your prompt and favorable response.

Sincerely,

DEA-2024-0059-28924,2024-07-11T04:00Z,Mary Baker,"I am providing comments in support of the reclassification of botanical cannabis (Docket No. DEA–1362).

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether – thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states – I nonetheless do not oppose the factual basis underlying HHS’ recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower. It would be arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to reject HHS’s findings of fact and to maintain existing prohibitions of the cannabis plant.
Medicinal cannabis has been a blessing for me. It was prescribed for my anxiety and PTSD. Childhood abuse and trauma has ruined my life and made me a dysfunctional human. Thankfully things have changed. I think clearer. I’m happier. More comfortable in public and alone. My thoughts aren’t so scattered and angry. I try to live a healthy lifestyle. Eating vegan, vegetarian. My mother was severely addicted to pills. I didn’t want to be on a lot of medications. Medical cannabis has been a life saver.

Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients’ access to medical marijuana. 

Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won’t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.

The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or “descheduling.” Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. 

Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana’s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. 

Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.

Given the Biden Administration’s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.

President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden’s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA. Karmala Harris .

I urge the Drug Enforcement Agency to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act, a move that would mark a step toward rectifying the harms caused by its criminalization. 

By descheduling cannabis, the federal government would be following the lead of 31 states that have already decriminalized the drug. In fact, the majority of people in the U.S.—70 percent, according to a November 2023 Gallup poll—support cannabis legalization. 

But rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, as the Department of Health & Human Services and the DEA have proposed, is insufficient. If cannabis remains on the CSA, people can continue to face penalties at the federal level for possession, including arrest and incarceration, which lead to a lifetime of consequences that impact someone’s ability to secure employment, housing, public benefits, educational opportunities, and more. 

The criminalization of cannabis—a legacy of the War on Drugs—was a policy decision rooted in racism. In the decades since, its enforcement has been disproportionately targeted at Black people and other people of color. It’s time to abandon this draconian approach. I support descheduling cannabis from the CSA—a step toward righting the wrongs of its criminalization.

I am writing to register my opposition to the recommendation to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. 

Rescheduling marijuana would allow the marijuana industry to deduct normal business expenses, including advertising and marketing expenses. This would make the industry profitable and incentivize them to spend even more on advertising and marketing.  This would likely cause marijuana sales and the harms associated with marijuana use to rise in tandem. Big Tobacco taught us the deleterious impact of advertising on youth: the more teens are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely they are to start smoking. The same will be true with marijuana. The marijuana industry will undoubtedly take a page out of Big Tobacco’s marketing playbook, making marijuana use look glamorous and benign with celebrity endorsements, candy flavoring (already seen in marijuana edibles), product placement in movies, and more. Even without the expected deluge of ads and marketing, marijuana use is at an all-time high. Teen use of marijuana is at 30- year high, with more teens reporting smoking marijuana than tobacco. Among young adults 19 to 30, 26% used in the past month compared to 17% in 2011, and 11% were daily users, up from 6% in 2011. 

HHS' recommendation failed to account for actual/relative potential for abuse or harms associated with use. Contrary to popular narrative, marijuana can be addictive. In fact, as many as 1 in 3 past year marijuana users met the clinical criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder. People who self-medicate with marijuana are not exempt from becoming addicted. According to research at Massachusetts General Hospital, “using cannabis products to treat pain, anxiety and depression failed to improve these symptoms while doubling the risk of developing the addictive symptoms of cannabis use disorder.” 

With the exception of one study of medical marijuana patients in Maryland, the review from HHS failed to acknowledge or consider the link between marijuana and psychosis. This is especially concerning in light of the rising potency of marijuana. Daily users of marijuana over 10% THC are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than non-users. A 2023 study in Denmark determined that 30% of cases of schizophrenia among 21–30-year-old males could have been averted if cannabis use disorder had been prevented. A 2022 study found that hospital discharges for marijuana-associated psychosis were higher in states with legal marijuana, another precursor if those who push full-scale commercialization have their way. 

Marijuana use is especially concerning in young people, a factor HHS failed to adequately address. The National Center for Education Statistics said, “adolescent marijuana use has been associated with lower academic performance and a higher risk of dropping out of high school.”  Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, warns, “Youth who use marijuana regularly are more likely to have a hard time learning, problems remembering, and lower math and reading scores. These effects can last weeks after the last time they used marijuana.” Recognizing that much remains unknown about marijuana, NIDA noted, “researchers are still studying how long marijuana’s effects last and whether some changes may be permanent.” 

Finally, while some states recognize “medical marijuana” there is no currently accepted medical use. Unlike other drugs in Schedule III, marijuana is not FDA approved to treat or cure any disease and it is not available for prescription in any state. In 2023, the American Medical Association adopted a position statement that “encourages hospitals and health systems to: (a) not recommend patient use of non-FDA approved cannabis or cannabis-derived products within healthcare facilities until such time as federal laws or regulations permit its use; and (b) educate medical staffs on cannabis use, effects and cannabis withdrawal syndrome.”

This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether – thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states – I nonetheless do not oppose the factual basis underlying HHS’ recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower. It would be arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to reject HHS’s findings of fact and to maintain existing prohibitions of the cannabis plant. I was addicted to pain pills for 13 years and would not have been able to break that addiction without cannabis.",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,0.9795801290186508

This is an important step toward a change in marijuana policy that addresses the decades-long discrimination against Black and Brown communities. 



Taking marijuana out of the same classification as more harmful substances like methamphetamine and heroin will give a huge boost to cannabis researchers and those in the cannabis business, and set the stage for further reparative measures for impacted communities.

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

Rescheduling marijuana would facilitate further research, enabling healthcare providers to prescribe it more freely and safely, ultimately improving the quality of life for many patients who have found relief through its use.

DEA-2024-0059-30604,2024-07-15T04:00Z,Paul Ranney,"Dear Drug Enforcement Administration,
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the DEA’s proposed rule change, which would
reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). I
am writing to express my concerns with this proposed rule. While I appreciate the Administration’s
recognition that marijuana should be removed from Schedule I, this proposed rule falls VERY short and
ultimately continues the decades of damage caused by the criminalization of
marijuana. Furthermore, the proposed rule misses an opportunity to align federal policy with where
much of the country is headed, and is completely out of step with where most Americans are on this
issue. Rather than rescheduling, I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and instead issue a
rule that would completely deschedule marijuana from the CSA.
Marijuana was initially included in the CSA pending a study and review by the National Commission
on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, better known as the Shafer Commission, over 50 years ago. That
study concluded that marijuana was no more dangerous than alcohol and recommended that it be
decriminalized. Nixon rejected this recommendation, and his domestic policy chief was later quoted
as saying this decision was predicated on a desire to weaponize criminalization and the so called
“War on Drugs” to target Black and Brown people and anti-war protestors. He stated: “We could
arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on
the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course, we did.”
We know the devastation this “War on Drugs” has wreaked on Black and Brown communities. In all
50 states, Black people are more likely to be arrested for marijuana offenses than white people,
despite similar usage rates. On average across the nation, a Black person is nearly four times as
likely to be arrested for a marijuana offense than a white person. While often touted for its
liberalism, in New York City 94 percent of all people arrested for marijuana offenses are people of
color. The last 50 years has taught us that we cannot achieve racial justice so long as this “War on
Drugs” is allowed to rage.
In addition to the racial injustice linked to criminalizing marijuana, the continued criminalization of
marijuana is incredibly fiscally irresponsible. Forty percent of all drug arrests in the U.S. are for
marijuana offenses, overwhelmingly for simple possession. In fact, arrests for marijuana outnumber
arrests for all violent crimes combined. It is estimated that the U.S. spends upwards of $7.6 billion
annually on the criminalization of marijuana. Putting aside the real harms caused by
criminalization, this is an enormous amount of taxpayer money that could be put to far better use.
This money could be used to fund schools, mental health and substance abuse services, proper
nutrition for families, and youth programming. Missouri legalized marijuana in 2020, and it is
projected that by the end of 2024 it will have generated $238 million in tax revenue. The state uses
that money to fund drug treatment, veteran services, and other important social programs. In
another example, Colorado generated $1.6 billion in tax revenue within a six-year period to fund
schools, literacy programs, and mental health services.
Widespread acceptance of marijuana has increased tremendously in recent decades. Twenty-four
states have completely legalized recreational marijuana, and over half of Americans live in a state
where it is legal. Another 14 states have legalized the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes. In
one of the most obvious signs that legalization is working, not a single state has reversed its
legalization of marijuana. Furthermore, 88 percent of Americans support legalization for either
recreational or medical use. And more than half of Americans state they have used marijuana,
making enforcement even more arbitrary.
States have long been considered the “laboratories of democracy,” the federal government should
follow the success of these states, and the will of the American people and deschedule marijuana.
Federal descheduling will demonstrate leadership in helping clear the path for the remaining states
to decriminalize marijuana, a crucial step in reducing the overcriminalization of Black and Brown
people. Thank you for considering my views, and again I urge you to update the proposed rule to
deschedule marijuana.  THC and all it's related derivatives is far less a ""gateway drug"" for more dangerous drug addictions - compared to poverty, poor housing, poor job availability, and the like!",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,0.981547604372976

DEA-2024-0059-19524,2024-06-17T04:00Z,Aixa Fielder,"Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEA’s proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administration’s efforts to reconsider marijuana’s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it’s time to end this country’s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA’s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.

Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients’ access to medical marijuana. 

Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won’t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.

The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or “descheduling.” Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. 

Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana’s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. 

Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.

Given the Biden Administration’s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.

President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden’s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.

I am writing to express my strong support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. This is an important and necessary step towards modernizing our nation's drug policies, reflecting current scientific understanding of cannabis' potential benefits and harms.



For too long, marijuana has been categorized alongside highly dangerous substances like methamphetamine, despite mounting evidence suggesting its relative safety. Reclassifying it to Schedule III would not only acknowledge this reality but also pave the way for further research into its medicinal properties and potential risks.



Furthermore, reclassification would provide much-needed regulatory clarity for businesses operating within the burgeoning cannabis industry. The tax benefits that stand to accrue from such a move could stimulate economic growth and job creation in communities across America.



I urge you to consider these points as you review this critical proposal. Reclassifying marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act is a commonsense move that aligns with both public sentiment and scientific evidence. It represents another significant step forward in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy.

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.  

Moreover, the FDA has approved a cannabis-plant-derived medicine Epidiolex for medical uses for severe forms of epilepsy and Marinol, a synthetic-based cannabis derived drug, has been approved by the FDA and used for cancer patients for almost 50 years. Just by these 2 facts alone, cannabis clearly defies the 3 part test that the DEA has proscribed for Schedule I and a substance need only fail 1 of the 3 tests to be disqualified for Schedule 1. 

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

In interim conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. 

That all said in support of Schedule III.. for next steps:  cannabis is a natural plant with tremendous health and wellness properties that are symbiotic with our natural human endocannabinoid system and has been used for healing and wellness without any prescription needed for thousands of years prior to the myths and fear-mongering started in the last century.  

Just as we can buy holistic natural medicines and health and wellness products in GNC or OTC at drug stores, we should be able to buy cannabis at natural food and supplement stores and drug stores. Both scientific clinical studies and a plethora of anecdotal evidence suggest that cannabis can be a safer and more effective treatment for pain, sleep and anxiety than traditional pharmaceutical products and is also far safer than smoking and alcohol, yet they are not scheduled substances.  

Accordingly. as a matter of public health, cannabis should as next steps be removed from the DEA's Schedules entirely.  

Thank you for your time.  We hope you'll do the right thing for American citizens and move cannabis to Schedule III and subsequently DEschedule it. 

In the meantime, I support the factual basis underlying HHS’ recommendation to move cannabis to Schedule III or lower. It would be arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to reject HHS’s findings of fact and to maintain existing prohibitions of the cannabis plant.

As a medical cannabis patient with a medical cannabis caregiver title overseeing the medical cannabis patient status of our 17 year old autistic son, I hereby gladly attest to years of medicinally beneficial medical cannabis use for not only both of us but also in that of four of his grandparents, one of whom struggles terribly with early onset dementia. My son has been terrified of nearly all ""wildlife"" and animals for more than a decade. For many years we dreaded having to take him out in public for fear of the reactions of others when he would ""melt-down"" while screaming with all his might, yet the whole horrible scene was all due to him simply sighting seagulls picking over trash in the parking lot as we drove in. However, Last year he rode a horse of his own volition and I feel that four years of prior cannabis use has helped him with this extreme anxiety he is stricken with upon viewing any animals or other wildlife. Beyond that accomplishment, he is also a non-expressive, mostly non-verbal autistic, but for the past three years he has been coming to us and telling us things and expressing himself unto melting our hearts every time he does simply because he never has. He's choosing things, holding basic conversations and initiating greetings towards others and his overall engagement is 100% improved since he has been a medical cannabis patient. All of this began emerging when he began utilizing medicinal cannabis and has only ever improved as time & usage continued unto present day. In our family, the reputation of cannabis has transformed from a shunned experimental party drug, to being considered (unanimously) as the natural medicine that it assuredly is. We all agree that any person who feels Marijuanna should remain classified as a dangerous drug has no sense of compassion and in all likelihood maintains an ulterior agenda of oppressiveness. No matter what happens with the legal condition of cannabis or its level of societal acceptance, our entire family will continue this mind-set and we will also continue to utilize this healing plant devoid of concern for its acceptance by others due in whole to our respect of its medicinal value (that value being only found in the results yeilded only by Marijuana).

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.

DEA-2024-0059-31080,2024-07-16T04:00Z,Lysa Rohan,"Dear Drug Enforcement Administration,
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the DEA’s proposed rule change, which would
reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). I
am writing to express my concerns with this proposed rule. While I appreciate the Administration’s
recognition that marijuana should be removed from Schedule I, this proposed rule falls short and
ultimately will not reduce the decades of damage caused by the criminalization of
marijuana. Furthermore, the proposed rule misses an opportunity to align federal policy with where
much of the country is headed, and is completely out of step with where most Americans are on this
issue. Rather than rescheduling, I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and instead issue a
rule that would completely deschedule marijuana from the CSA.
Marijuana was initially included in the CSA pending a study and review by the National Commission
on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, better known as the Shafer Commission, over 50 years ago. That
study concluded that marijuana was no more dangerous than alcohol and recommended that it be
decriminalized. Nixon rejected this recommendation, and his domestic policy chief was later quoted
as saying this decision was predicated on a desire to weaponize criminalization and the so called
“War on Drugs” to target Black and Brown people and anti-war protestors. He stated: “We could
arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on
the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course, we did.”
We know the devastation this “War on Drugs” has wreaked on Black and Brown communities. In all
50 states, Black people are more likely to be arrested for marijuana offenses than white people,
despite similar usage rates. On average across the nation, a Black person is nearly four times as
likely to be arrested for a marijuana offense than a white person. While often touted for its
liberalism, in New York City 94 percent of all people arrested for marijuana offenses are people of
color. The last 50 years has taught us that we cannot achieve racial justice so long as this “War on
Drugs” is allowed to rage.
In addition to the racial injustice linked to criminalizing marijuana, the continued criminalization of
marijuana is incredibly fiscally irresponsible. Forty percent of all drug arrests in the U.S. are for
marijuana offenses, overwhelmingly for simple possession. In fact, arrests for marijuana outnumber
arrests for all violent crimes combined. It is estimated that the U.S. spends upwards of $7.6 billion
annually on the criminalization of marijuana. Putting aside the real harms caused by
criminalization, this is an enormous amount of taxpayer money that could be put to far better use.
This money could be used to fund schools, mental health and substance abuse services, proper
nutrition for families, and youth programming. Missouri legalized marijuana in 2020, and it is
projected that by the end of 2024 it will have generated $238 million in tax revenue. The state uses
that money to fund drug treatment, veteran services, and other important social programs. In
another example, Colorado generated $1.6 billion in tax revenue within a six-year period to fund
schools, literacy programs, and mental health services.
Widespread acceptance of marijuana has increased tremendously in recent decades. Twenty-four
states have completely legalized recreational marijuana, and over half of Americans live in a state
where it is legal. Another 14 states have legalized the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes. In
one of the most obvious signs that legalization is working, not a single state has reversed its
legalization of marijuana. Furthermore, 88 percent of Americans support legalization for either
recreational or medical use. And more than half of Americans state they have used marijuana,
making enforcement even more arbitrary.
States have long been considered the “laboratories of democracy,” the federal government should
follow the success of these states, and the will of the American people and deschedule marijuana.
Federal descheduling will demonstrate leadership in helping clear the path for the remaining states
to decriminalize marijuana, a crucial step in reducing the overcriminalization of Black and Brown
people. Thank you for considering my views, and again I urge you to update the proposed rule to
deschedule marijuana.

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

I am writing to express my strong support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. This is an important and necessary step towards modernizing our nation's drug policies, reflecting current scientific understanding of cannabis' potential benefits and harms.



For too long, marijuana has been categorized alongside highly dangerous substances like methamphetamine, despite mounting evidence suggesting its relative safety. Reclassifying it to Schedule III would not only acknowledge this reality but also pave the way for further research into its medicinal properties and potential risks.



Furthermore, reclassification would provide much-needed regulatory clarity for businesses operating within the burgeoning cannabis industry. The tax benefits that stand to accrue from such a move could stimulate economic growth and job creation in communities across America.



I urge you to consider these points as you review this critical proposal. Reclassifying marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act is a commonsense move that aligns with both public sentiment and scientific evidence. It represents another significant step forward in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy.

This is an important step toward a change in marijuana policy that addresses the decades-long discrimination against Black and Brown communities. 



Taking marijuana out of the same classification as more harmful substances like methamphetamine and heroin will give a huge boost to cannabis researchers and those in the cannabis business, and set the stage for further reparative measures for impacted communities.

I urge the Drug Enforcement Agency to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act, a move that would mark a step toward rectifying the harms caused by its criminalization. 

By descheduling cannabis, the federal government would be following the lead of 31 states that have already decriminalized the drug. In fact, the majority of people in the U.S.—70 percent, according to a November 2023 Gallup poll—support cannabis legalization. 

But rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, as the Department of Health & Human Services and the DEA have proposed, is insufficient. If cannabis remains on the CSA, people can continue to face penalties at the federal level for possession, including arrest and incarceration, which lead to a lifetime of consequences that impact someone’s ability to secure employment, housing, public benefits, educational opportunities, and more. 

The criminalization of cannabis—a legacy of the War on Drugs—was a policy decision rooted in racism. In the decades since, its enforcement has been disproportionately targeted at Black people and other people of color. It’s time to abandon this draconian approach.

Moving cannabis into a category of drugs that have a low risk of dependence gives the public false information about this drug.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and the World Health Organization have all acknowledged that marijuana is much more potent than ever before. In the 1970s, the THC level in marijuana products was only 2%, but today the level is up to 18%-35% THC. Items such as gummies, drinks, and candies containing cannabis make this vice more appealing and easier to consume. The increased THC amounts plus the ease of consuming it has led to an uptick in cannabis use disorders, schizophrenia, and cannabis hyperemesis syndrome.

The well-being of children is at risk. Teen use of marijuana is at an all-time high with 30% of high school seniors having used cannabis. Emergency room visits are on the rise with the large majority of psychiatric events caused by marijuana use.

Rescheduling marijuana is unscientific and harmful. I ask that you recognize the downfalls of this type of policy and keep marijuana as a Schedule I drug. I used to prosecute marijuana cases and in my experience the use of marijuana harms the user and frequently leads to the use of other more powerful illegal drugs.

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision. I have been a medical cannabis patient for the past four years. It has provided me great relief from pain and anxiety, and has helped me avoid other controlled substances that would otherwise have been used to treat these symptoms.

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs.

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether – thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states – I nonetheless do not oppose the factual basis underlying HHS’ recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower.

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 
41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

The Federal Government has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1978, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 
Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III .

Nonpsychoactive cannabinoids, such as cannabidoil, are particularly advantageous to use because they avoid toxicity that is encountered with psychoactive cannabinoids at high doses useful in the method of the present invention.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has rightly determined that cannabis ""has a currently accepted medical use"" and that its potential for abuse does not justify its classification as a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.
HHS reached this conclusion based on the broad consensus in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate role in treating specific conditions, such as pain, and can be administered safely under medical supervision. Forty-one states have established regulations for the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products for qualified patients. Approximately six million patients and 30,000 healthcare practitioners participate in these state programs, some of which have been operating for several decades without any state repealing patients' access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This demonstrates that cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, with public health benefits significantly outweighing any potential risks.
Foundationally, cannabis has never met the criteria for classification as a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. Although we advocate for cannabis to be removed from the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) entirely — aligning federal policy with most US states — we support the HHS recommendation to reschedule botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower. It would be unreasonable for the DEA to ignore HHS's findings and maintain the current prohibitions on the cannabis plant.
We believe rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III represents a step towards addressing the negative impacts of the United States' failed War on Drugs. However, the full benefits of this plant and the pursuit of justice and reconciliation will only be realized when cannabis is completely descheduled. As we continue to strive for this outcome, Puffco remains dedicated to combating the stigmas surrounding cannabis and advocating for the healing of communities of color that have suffered harm for decades across the nation.

DEA-2024-0059-28154,2024-07-10T04:00Z,Brian Walker,"As a past user of marijuana I will say this, alcohol is far more dangerous then using marijuana in so many ways. I currently do not use marijuana due to drug testing at my workplace. I do consume alcohol from time to time but would rather be able to use marijuana due to it being more relaxing and also helps with my aches and pains. It’s time to legalize marijuana across the board not just reschedule. It needs to be federally legal so Americans can have the choice to be able to enjoy it as it was meant to be. It’s ok to drink alcohol which is absolutely horrible, mentallly and physically. There is no good reason for it to be illegal. Plus states and government would reap the benefits of the taxation on it. Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEA’s proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administration’s efforts to reconsider marijuana’s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it’s time to end this country’s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA’s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.

Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients’ access to medical marijuana. 

Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won’t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.

The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or “descheduling.” Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. 

Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana’s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana laws. 


President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden’s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization.

DEA-2024-0059-35454,2024-07-20T04:00Z,Peggy Goodwin,"Marijuana is bombarding our communities in Michigan.  It is wreaking havoc in our schools. I've seen what addiction, beginning with marijuana, can do to people, families, children.  How lives are derailed.  It is a dangerous drug.  The slick ads that bombard are mailboxes are targeting young people with developing brains.  It should be illegal and prescribed for medicinal purposes only.

I am writing to register my opposition to the recommendation to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. 

Rescheduling marijuana would allow the marijuana industry to deduct normal business expenses, including advertising and marketing expenses. This would make the industry profitable and incentivize them to spend even more on advertising and marketing.  This would likely cause marijuana sales and the harms associated with marijuana use to rise in tandem. Big Tobacco taught us the deleterious impact of advertising on youth: the more teens are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely they are to start smoking. The same will be true with marijuana. The marijuana industry will undoubtedly take a page out of Big Tobacco’s marketing playbook, making marijuana use look glamorous and benign with celebrity endorsements, candy flavoring (already seen in marijuana edibles), product placement in movies, and more. Even without the expected deluge of ads and marketing, marijuana use is at an all-time high. Teen use of marijuana is at 30- year high, with more teens reporting smoking marijuana than tobacco. Among young adults 19 to 30, 26% used in the past month compared to 17% in 2011, and 11% were daily users, up from 6% in 2011. 

HHS' recommendation failed to account for actual/relative potential for abuse or harms associated with use. Contrary to popular narrative, marijuana can be addictive. In fact, as many as 1 in 3 past year marijuana users met the clinical criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder. People who self-medicate with marijuana are not exempt from becoming addicted. According to research at Massachusetts General Hospital, “using cannabis products to treat pain, anxiety and depression failed to improve these symptoms while doubling the risk of developing the addictive symptoms of cannabis use disorder.” 

With the exception of one study of medical marijuana patients in Maryland, the review from HHS failed to acknowledge or consider the link between marijuana and psychosis. This is especially concerning in light of the rising potency of marijuana. Daily users of marijuana over 10% THC are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than non-users. A 2023 study in Denmark determined that 30% of cases of schizophrenia among 21–30-year-old males could have been averted if cannabis use disorder had been prevented. A 2022 study found that hospital discharges for marijuana-associated psychosis were higher in states with legal marijuana, another precursor if those who push full-scale commercialization have their way. 

Marijuana use is especially concerning in young people, a factor HHS failed to adequately address. The National Center for Education Statistics said, “adolescent marijuana use has been associated with lower academic performance and a higher risk of dropping out of high school.”  Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, warns, “Youth who use marijuana regularly are more likely to have a hard time learning, problems remembering, and lower math and reading scores. These effects can last weeks after the last time they used marijuana.” Recognizing that much remains unknown about marijuana, NIDA noted, “researchers are still studying how long marijuana’s effects last and whether some changes may be permanent.” 

Finally, while some states recognize “medical marijuana” there is no currently accepted medical use. Unlike other drugs in Schedule III, marijuana is not FDA approved to treat or cure any disease and it is not available for prescription in any state. In 2023, the American Medical Association adopted a position statement that “encourages hospitals and health systems to: (a) not recommend patient use of non-FDA approved cannabis or cannabis-derived products within healthcare facilities until such time as federal laws or regulations permit its use; and (b) educate medical staffs on cannabis use, effects and cannabis withdrawal syndrome.”

DEA-2024-0059-7553,2024-05-29T04:00Z,Donna Rauch,"To Whom it May Concern:

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.

Further schedule III has the potential to destroy recreational marijuana programs, which have been implemented in half the states at this point, and the majority of Americans live in a state with legal recreational cannabis. States have legalized recreational marijuana and the statistics are clear that youth consumption drops, there are not large amounts of people admitted to the ER for so called ""cannabis psychosis"", and thousands of jobs and tax dollars for the state are created while freeing up law enforcement resources. In terms of harm cannabis ranks far safer in studies than alcohol and tobacco (legal in all 50 states and specifically excluded from the csa).

DEA-2024-0059-9656,2024-05-31T04:00Z,Butch Black,"I am providing comments in support of the reclassification of botanical cannabis (Docket No. DEA–1362).

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether – thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states – I nonetheless do not oppose the factual basis underlying HHS’ recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower. It would be arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to reject HHS’s findings of fact and to maintain existing prohibitions of the cannabis plant. Cannabis has been in widespread use since the 1960s.

DEA-2024-0059-16948,2024-06-12T04:00Z,Laura Bruce,"The high potency THC available on the legal and illegal market in my community is only making substance use worse in my neighborhood and region.  With THC vapes, which are very available to youth and come in a variety of flavors, delivering potencies over 70% (compared to the 2-3% THC potency available in the 1970's), we are seeing more addiction and early youth initiation.  While tobacco and alcohol use is going down, youth use of marijuana is increasing.   This rescheduling will cause undue harm to my community, and allow another addiction-for-profit industry (Big Marijuana) to take hold.

I am writing to register my opposition to the recommendation to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. 

Rescheduling marijuana would allow the marijuana industry to deduct normal business expenses, including advertising and marketing expenses. This would make the industry profitable and incentivize them to spend even more on advertising and marketing.  This would likely cause marijuana sales and the harms associated with marijuana use to rise in tandem. Big Tobacco taught us the deleterious impact of advertising on youth: the more teens are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely they are to start smoking. The same will be true with marijuana. The marijuana industry will undoubtedly take a page out of Big Tobacco’s marketing playbook, making marijuana use look glamorous and benign with celebrity endorsements, candy flavoring (already seen in marijuana edibles), product placement in movies, and more. Even without the expected deluge of ads and marketing, marijuana use is at an all-time high. Teen use of marijuana is at 30- year high, with more teens reporting smoking marijuana than tobacco. Among young adults 19 to 30, 26% used in the past month compared to 17% in 2011, and 11% were daily users, up from 6% in 2011. 

HHS' recommendation failed to account for actual/relative potential for abuse or harms associated with use. Contrary to popular narrative, marijuana can be addictive. In fact, as many as 1 in 3 past year marijuana users met the clinical criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder. People who self-medicate with marijuana are not exempt from becoming addicted. According to research at Massachusetts General Hospital, “using cannabis products to treat pain, anxiety and depression failed to improve these symptoms while doubling the risk of developing the addictive symptoms of cannabis use disorder.” 

With the exception of one study of medical marijuana patients in Maryland, the review from HHS failed to acknowledge or consider the link between marijuana and psychosis. This is especially concerning in light of the rising potency of marijuana. Daily users of marijuana over 10% THC are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than non-users. A 2023 study in Denmark determined that 30% of cases of schizophrenia among 21–30-year-old males could have been averted if cannabis use disorder had been prevented. A 2022 study found that hospital discharges for marijuana-associated psychosis were higher in states with legal marijuana, another precursor if those who push full-scale commercialization have their way. 

Marijuana use is especially concerning in young people, a factor HHS failed to adequately address. The National Center for Education Statistics said, “adolescent marijuana use has been associated with lower academic performance and a higher risk of dropping out of high school.”  Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, warns, “Youth who use marijuana regularly are more likely to have a hard time learning, problems remembering, and lower math and reading scores. These effects can last weeks after the last time they used marijuana.” Recognizing that much remains unknown about marijuana, NIDA noted, “researchers are still studying how long marijuana’s effects last and whether some changes may be permanent.” 

Finally, while some states recognize “medical marijuana” there is no currently accepted medical use. Unlike other drugs in Schedule III, marijuana is not FDA approved to treat or cure any disease and it is not available for prescription in any state. In 2023, the American Medical Association adopted a position statement that “encourages hospitals and health systems to: (a) not recommend patient use of non-FDA approved cannabis or cannabis-derived products within healthcare facilities until such time as federal laws or regulations permit its use; and (b) educate medical staffs on cannabis use, effects and cannabis withdrawal syndrome.”

Subject: Urgent Request for Rescheduling of Cannabis

I am writing to you today in my dual capacity as a physician with decades of experience treating patients and as a State Representative in the Tennessee House of Representatives. In my role as a State Representative, I also serve as the Chairman of the Health Committee of the Tennessee House of Representatives. My experience in these roles compels me to urge the Attorney General, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Department of Justice to reconsider the current classification of cannabis as a drug on schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). 

As a physician, I have witnessed firsthand the potential benefits of cannabis-based medicines for a wide range of medical conditions. These include, but are not limited to:
·	Chronic pain: Studies have shown that cannabinoids, the active compounds in cannabis, can be effective in reducing chronic pain associated with conditions like arthritis, neuropathy, and migraines.
·	Epilepsy: Mounting evidence suggests that cannabis-based medications can significantly reduce seizure frequency in patients with intractable epilepsy, particularly children, for whom traditional medications often prove ineffective.
·	Glaucoma: Cannabis can help lower intraocular pressure, a key factor in glaucoma progression.
·	Multiple Sclerosis (MS): Cannabis can alleviate symptoms of MS such as spasticity, pain, and tremors, improving patients' quality of life.
·	Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV): Cannabis is a well-documented and effective antiemetic, providing relief to cancer patients struggling with CINV.

The current Schedule I classification presents a significant barrier to research and development of these potentially life-changing medications. This classification implies that cannabis has a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use, a demonstrably inaccurate assessment.

In my role as a State Representative, I am keenly aware of the public's growing interest in safe, effective medical cannabis options. Many constituents have shared their positive experiences with these medications and their frustration with the current legal limitations.

I urge the Attorney General, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Department of Justice to promptly reschedule cannabis to a more appropriate category that reflects its growing body of scientific evidence for medical use and its lower potential for abuse compared to Schedule I drugs like heroin. This action would allow for further research, facilitate patient access to these potentially life-saving medications, and align federal policy with the growing body of scientific evidence and public opinion.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

I am writing to express my support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. 



This is an important step toward a change in marijuana policy that addresses the decades-long discrimination against Black and Brown communities. 



Taking marijuana out of the same classification as more harmful substances like methamphetamine and heroin will give a huge boost to cannabis researchers and those in the cannabis business, and set the stage for further reparative measures for impacted communities. 



Reclassifying marijuana is a necessary step that will move the needle in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy and I urge you to pass this new rule and push back against this nation’s archaic laws against cannabis possession. Marijuana really should be legalized. Make tax revenues off it instead of wasting tax dollars fighting it.

While I appreciate the Biden Administration’s efforts to reconsider marijuana’s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it’s time to end this country’s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA’s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.

Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients’ access to medical marijuana. 

Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won’t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.

The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or “descheduling.” Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. 

Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana’s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. 

Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.

Given the Biden Administration’s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.

President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden’s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.

While classifying marijuana as Schedule III does pave the way for further research and is a step in the right direction, it does not go far enough. There have already been studies which demonstrate that the physical addictive potential for marijuana and the active cannabinoids contained therein are far lower than unscheduled substances like nicotine and alcohol. Additionally, the harm potential for third parties exposed to individuals under the influence of marijuana is significantly lower than reported harms posed by alcohol according to the attached NIH study.

I am writing to express my strong support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. This is an important and necessary step towards modernizing our nation's drug policies, reflecting current scientific understanding of cannabis' potential benefits and harms.



For too long, marijuana has been categorized alongside highly dangerous substances like methamphetamine, despite mounting evidence suggesting its relative safety. Reclassifying it to Schedule III would not only acknowledge this reality but also pave the way for further research into its medicinal properties and potential risks.



Furthermore, reclassification would provide much-needed regulatory clarity for businesses operating within the burgeoning cannabis industry. The tax benefits that stand to accrue from such a move could stimulate economic growth and job creation in communities across America.



I urge you to consider these points as you review this critical proposal. Reclassifying marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act is a commonsense move that aligns with both public sentiment and scientific evidence. It represents another significant step forward in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy.



Thank you for your attention to this matter.

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance, thus science tells us it does not belong in the schedules.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.  It certainly does not have the addiction risks of most drugs used for pain, and research to date find few side effect risks warranting possible concerns.

DEA-2024-0059-36143,2024-07-22T04:00Z,Brian Baker,"As a disabled veteran and small business owner, I thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEA’s proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Rescheduling is a half measure that still stifles state economies and prevents American Veterans from accessing the medicine they want, need, and deserve in place of the opioid poison that the VA crams down our throats for every possible malady. While I appreciate the Biden Administration’s efforts to reconsider marijuana’s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I am upset about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA where both the citizens o the united states and every corner of science knows it does not belong. it’s time to end this chapter of our country’s failed drug war by completely removing marijuana from the CSA’s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.

Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end the incredible amounts we spend fighting Marijuana and locking up marijuana users. I am tired of seeing money that could go to fix our crumbling infrastructure, declining schools, and failing health care system. We are imprisoning otherwise hard working Americans because they prefer to smoke a plant instead of drink alcohol to relax at the end of a hard day's work. Instead of letting he cartels and black market dealers have every penny of marijuana sales that we all know are happening in this country every day in the billions, let's remove this dumb ass scheduling so we can take that money and use it to make our country better. 38 states in our union have some form of legalized marijuana. 24 states have legalized adult use marijuana with recreational initiatives going to the voters in several more. The people of the united states have already spoken loudly across the nation in support of their freedom to use Marijuana. 

Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won’t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.

The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or “descheduling.” Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. 

Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana’s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. 

Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.

Given the Biden Administration’s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,0.7958135283000849

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.

I have personally been positively affected by medical cannabis. Several years ago, I was diagnosed with PTSD, depression, and general anxiety. For about 18 months thereafter, I tried various prescribed medications and treatments, including psychotherapy.

The medications didn't help; rather, my condition worsened, and I eventually checked myself into a mental hospital due to suicidal ideation. I was ready to try something different, and although Texas has severely limited access to medical cannabis, my PTSD diagnosis qualified me. I went through the proper channels, and became a part of the Compassionate Use Program. After only a few months, I safely reduced and eliminated my use of all psychiatric medications.

Since that time, my condition and outlook has improved significantly. Combined with a solid support system and healthy habits, medical cannabis is helping me reframe and overcome my trauma. I can perform my work and socialize more easily. My family even says I seem more like myself than I have in years! Now, I am more motivated and less negative.

I am writing to register my opposition to the recommendation to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. 

Rescheduling marijuana would allow the marijuana industry to deduct normal business expenses, including advertising and marketing expenses. This would make the industry profitable and incentivize them to spend even more on advertising and marketing.  This would likely cause marijuana sales and the harms associated with marijuana use to rise in tandem. Big Tobacco taught us the deleterious impact of advertising on youth: the more teens are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely they are to start smoking. The same will be true with marijuana. The marijuana industry will undoubtedly take a page out of Big Tobacco’s marketing playbook, making marijuana use look glamorous and benign with celebrity endorsements, candy flavoring (already seen in marijuana edibles), product placement in movies, and more. Even without the expected deluge of ads and marketing, marijuana use is at an all-time high. Teen use of marijuana is at 30- year high, with more teens reporting smoking marijuana than tobacco. Among young adults 19 to 30, 26% used in the past month compared to 17% in 2011, and 11% were daily users, up from 6% in 2011. 

HHS' recommendation failed to account for actual/relative potential for abuse or harms associated with use. Contrary to popular narrative, marijuana can be addictive. In fact, as many as 1 in 3 past year marijuana users met the clinical criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder. People who self-medicate with marijuana are not exempt from becoming addicted. According to research at Massachusetts General Hospital, “using cannabis products to treat pain, anxiety and depression failed to improve these symptoms while doubling the risk of developing the addictive symptoms of cannabis use disorder.” 

With the exception of one study of medical marijuana patients in Maryland, the review from HHS failed to acknowledge or consider the link between marijuana and psychosis. This is especially concerning in light of the rising potency of marijuana. Daily users of marijuana over 10% THC are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than non-users. A 2023 study in Denmark determined that 30% of cases of schizophrenia among 21–30-year-old males could have been averted if cannabis use disorder had been prevented. A 2022 study found that hospital discharges for marijuana-associated psychosis were higher in states with legal marijuana, another precursor if those who push full-scale commercialization have their way. 

Marijuana use is especially concerning in young people, a factor HHS failed to adequately address. The National Center for Education Statistics said, “adolescent marijuana use has been associated with lower academic performance and a higher risk of dropping out of high school.”  Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, warns, “Youth who use marijuana regularly are more likely to have a hard time learning, problems remembering, and lower math and reading scores. These effects can last weeks after the last time they used marijuana.” Recognizing that much remains unknown about marijuana, NIDA noted, “researchers are still studying how long marijuana’s effects last and whether some changes may be permanent.” 

Finally, while some states recognize “medical marijuana” there is no currently accepted medical use. Unlike other drugs in Schedule III, marijuana is not FDA approved to treat or cure any disease and it is not available for prescription in any state. In 2023, the American Medical Association adopted a position statement that “encourages hospitals and health systems to: (a) not recommend patient use of non-FDA approved cannabis or cannabis-derived products within healthcare facilities until such time as federal laws or regulations permit its use; and (b) educate medical staffs on cannabis use, effects and cannabis withdrawal syndrome.”

I urge the Drug Enforcement Agency to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act, a move that would mark a step toward rectifying the harms caused by its criminalization. 

By descheduling cannabis, the federal government would be following the lead of 31 states that have already decriminalized the drug. In fact, the majority of people in the U.S.—70 percent, according to a November 2023 Gallup poll—support cannabis legalization. 

But rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, as the Department of Health & Human Services and the DEA have proposed, is insufficient. If cannabis remains on the CSA, people can continue to face penalties at the federal level for possession, including arrest and incarceration, which lead to a lifetime of consequences that impact someone’s ability to secure employment, housing, public benefits, educational opportunities, and more. 

The criminalization of cannabis—a legacy of the War on Drugs—was a policy decision rooted in racism. In the decades since, its enforcement has been disproportionately targeted at Black people and other people of color. It’s time to abandon this draconian approach. I support descheduling cannabis from the CSA—a step toward righting the wrongs of its criminalization.

There are n0w tests which can be performed by police to determine of a driver (say) is under the influence of cannabis.  This development removes the last major objection to decriminalizing cannabis.",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,0.877826944

Dear Drug Enforcement Administration,
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the DEA’s proposed rule change, which would
reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). I
am writing to express my concerns with this proposed rule. While I appreciate the Administration’s
recognition that marijuana should be removed from Schedule I, this proposed rule falls short and
ultimately will not reduce the decades of damage caused by the criminalization of
marijuana. Furthermore, the proposed rule misses an opportunity to align federal policy with where
much of the country is headed, and is completely out of step with where most Americans are on this
issue. Rather than rescheduling, I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and instead issue a
rule that would completely deschedule marijuana from the CSA.
Marijuana was initially included in the CSA pending a study and review by the National Commission
on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, better known as the Shafer Commission, over 50 years ago. That
study concluded that marijuana was no more dangerous than alcohol and recommended that it be
decriminalized. Nixon rejected this recommendation, and his domestic policy chief was later quoted
as saying this decision was predicated on a desire to weaponize criminalization and the so called
“War on Drugs” to target Black and Brown people and anti-war protestors. He stated: “We could
arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on
the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course, we did.”
We know the devastation this “War on Drugs” has wreaked on Black and Brown communities. In all
50 states, Black people are more likely to be arrested for marijuana offenses than white people,
despite similar usage rates. On average across the nation, a Black person is nearly four times as
likely to be arrested for a marijuana offense than a white person. While often touted for its
liberalism, in New York City 94 percent of all people arrested for marijuana offenses are people of
color. The last 50 years has taught us that we cannot achieve racial justice so long as this “War on
Drugs” is allowed to rage.

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.

I am a cannabis specialist and general manager of a small hemp company. I have worked with this company since the farm bill was passed in 2018 and I have never had a more fulfilling job. Every single day I hear testimonies from my customers about how our cannabis products provide them with long lasting relief from numerous medical conditions, relief they had been searching for for years. Our customers conditions can range from insomnia, depression, pain, cancers, drug addiction, adhd, autism, anxiety and etc. And these customers finding relief from cannabis, come from all walks of life, nurses, teachers, stay at home parents, lawyers, city clerks and councilmen, disabled veterans. They are not druggies seeking drugs, they are average people just seeking relief and relaxation.
Rescheduling cannabis would be a positive step toward finally remove some of the harmful stigma around this very precious healing herb. However, it still limits all we can do with this helpful plant.
The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether – thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states – I nonetheless do not oppose the factual basis underlying HHS’ recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower. It would be arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to reject HHS’s findings of fact and to maintain existing prohibitions of the cannabis plant.",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,0.769155995

While I appreciate the Biden Administration’s efforts to reconsider marijuana’s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it’s time to end this country’s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA’s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.

Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients’ access to medical marijuana. 

Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won’t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.

The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or “descheduling.” Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. 

Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana’s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. 

Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.

Given the Biden Administration’s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.

President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden’s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.

Results showed that Sativex reduced spasticity and improved mobility and quality of life in MS patients compared to placebo.

Koehler et al., 2019:
Published in Frontiers in Neurology, this systematic review and meta-analysis analyzed the efficacy and safety of cannabinoids in treating symptoms of MS.
It concluded that cannabinoids, particularly THC and CBD, showed potential in reducing spasticity and pain in MS patients, although more high-quality clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings.

Freeman et al., 2020:
Published in JAMA Network Open, this randomized clinical trial examined the effects of cannabinoids on spasticity and pain in MS patients.
The study found that cannabinoids (including THC and CBD) reduced patient-reported spasticity and pain severity compared to placebo, suggesting their potential as adjunctive therapies in MS management.

My wife Andrea is a Chilean citizen. We have been together for over 4 years, and we just celebrated one year of marriage. I am an organic vegetable farmer in Burlington, Vermont, and my wife has never once been able to come and visit my farm or see my life here. She is inadmissible to the United States because she has on her record (from almost 8 years ago) the possession of a small amount of cannabis for personal use.

We went through the fiancée visa application process hoping to start our lives together in Vermont and raise a family, but she was denied at the interview on the grounds of inadmissibility (we were planning on marrying in the US but got married soon after the denial). We had been told so many things by friends, family, even attorneys, that it didn't seem like a big deal, marijuana is such a little thing these days, and it seemed true; cannabis is legal in my state and there are retail recreational stores all over the city I live in. 

She was denied the visa because she was in violation of the Controlled Substance Act. I was so heartbroken to learn that moving cannabis from Schedule 1 to Schedule 3 would do nothing to improve our chances of being together. These rules are outrageously unfair and outdated. I miss my wife every day and the time and the energy (and money) we need to spend traveling to keep our marriage alive is beyond your wildest imagination.

Instead of building a home and raising a family with my wife I am living with my elderly aunt so that I can afford to travel during my time away form the farm in the winter. I can feel my hopes for the future being crushed by this unfair prohibition, and it has honestly caused me to suffer devastating humiliation. I work so hard, pay taxes, I'm a business owner and a job creator, and I'm being denied my happiness and constitutional right to enjoy my marriage because of these laws.

I am urging the Biden Administration to help my wife Andrea and I finally be together. Our lawyers think it could be anywhere from 2 to 4 more years filing more paperwork, waivers, fees, and on and on, suffering needlessly, and that there is a chance we will ultimately be denied because it may not be found that I am enduring 'extreme hardship' (which I can assure you I most certainly am). 

Both Andrea and I are getting older... I can feel our chances of having kids one day slowly slipping away while at the same time we are senselessly committing our resources to fighting something that basically every citizen of this country would have to admit wasn't even a minor misdemeanor if they were to consider it a crime at all.

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.

DEA-2024-0059-9011,2024-05-31T04:00Z,Rebeca Atwood,"I am providing comments in support of the reclassification of botanical cannabis (Docket No. DEA–1362).

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

I myself have been a patient with a medical cannabis license for 4 years, after being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2020. Cannabis has been an extremely important part of helping me cope with the pain and discomfort of cancer and the loss of appetite, not to mention the extreme anxiety and sleeplessness that goes along with having cancer. I have had zero negative side effects and absolutely no inclination for addiction. This plant is a priceless asset that doesn’t even deserve to be compared in any way to dangerous substances like alcohol, nicotine, opioids and other illegal drugs.

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether – thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states – I nonetheless do not oppose the factual basis underlying HHS’ recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower. It would be arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to reject HHS’s findings of fact and to maintain existing prohibitions of the cannabis plant.

I am writing to express my strong support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. This is an important and necessary step towards modernizing our nation's drug policies, reflecting current scientific understanding of cannabis' potential benefits and harms.



For too long, marijuana has been categorized alongside highly dangerous substances like methamphetamine, despite mounting evidence suggesting its relative safety. Reclassifying it to Schedule III would not only acknowledge this reality but also pave the way for further research into its medicinal properties and potential risks.



Furthermore, reclassification would provide much-needed regulatory clarity for businesses operating within the burgeoning cannabis industry. The tax benefits that stand to accrue from such a move could stimulate economic growth and job creation in communities across America.



I urge you to consider these points as you review this critical proposal. Reclassifying marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act is a commonsense move that aligns with both public sentiment and scientific evidence. It represents another significant step forward in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy.

Marijuana has statistically been shown to alleviate pain, reduce nausea, and generally increase the overall well being of any individual suffering with health issues - whether it be cancer, Parkinson's, or epilepsy. Marijuana shouldn't even be classified as a controlled substance. Yes it should be limited to those 21+. But alcohol is much worse and doesn't fall under the FDA  controlled substances act. As a recovering alcoholic, and one who used marijuana prior to the start of my career in 2014 (I get drug tested), I would love to be able to legally use marijuana for chronic pain relief that I have suffered from for almost a decade. Instead, I use Kratom. Another ""wishy-washy"" substance that is considered a class 1 narcotic, but only in certain states. I live in MO, and can walk into any vape shop to purchase it. However some states such as Indiana and Wisconsin, states that I frequent, it is considered a class 1 narcotic. How does that make sense? Its a plant. And it's ""legal"" in other states. Just like marijuana. And it's a plant. I  would rather ingest a plant, then take a manufactured pharmaceutical like ibuprofen or Tylenol. 

Hopefully this gets us one step closer to full legalization. The government is a joke. They could stand to make so much more money by taxing it. I hate to admit that but it's true. Its a harmless plant with so many helpful benefits. It was outlawed because of racism, and this country has too much of that.

Moving cannabis into a category of drugs that have a low risk of dependence gives the public false information about this drug. I see patients with marijuana related complications almost every day. We certainly do not need to do anything to increase the availability and use of marijuana leading to more hospital admissions and use of needed healthcare resources!

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and the World Health Organization have all acknowledged that marijuana is much more potent than ever before. In the 1970s, the THC level in marijuana products was only 2%, but today the level is up to 18%-35% THC. Items such as gummies, drinks, and candies containing cannabis make this vice more appealing and easier to consume. The increased THC amounts plus the ease of consuming it has led to an uptick in cannabis use disorders, schizophrenia, and cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. 

The well-being of children is at risk. Teen use of marijuana is at an all-time high with 30% of high school seniors having used cannabis. Emergency room visits are on the rise with the large majority of psychiatric events caused by marijuana use.

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

I am writing to express my support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. 



This is an important step toward a change in marijuana policy that addresses the decades-long discrimination against Black and Brown communities. 



Taking marijuana out of the same classification as more harmful substances like methamphetamine and heroin will give a huge boost to cannabis researchers and those in the cannabis business, and set the stage for further reparative measures for impacted communities. 



Reclassifying marijuana is a necessary step that will move the needle in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy and I urge you to pass this new rule and push back against this nation’s archaic laws against cannabis possession.

DEA-2024-0059-6076,2024-05-27T04:00Z,Rafael Gosser,"Dear Administrator,

I am writing in response to the Department of Justice's proposed rulemaking to reclassify marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), as announced on May 20, 2024. While I appreciate the acknowledgment of marijuana's medical use and its relatively lower potential for abuse compared to substances in Schedules I and II, I believe that full legalization is the more appropriate course of action.

The proposal recognizes the medical benefits of marijuana and its reduced abuse potential. However, keeping it as a Schedule III substance continues to impose unnecessary barriers to access and research. Full legalization would align federal policy with the growing consensus among states that have already established regulatory frameworks recognizing the therapeutic benefits of cannabis.

Additionally, the ongoing criminalization of marijuana disproportionately impacts marginalized communities, contributing to social and racial injustices. Full legalization would help address these disparities and allow for the expungement of records for individuals previously convicted of non-violent cannabis offenses.

I urge the DEA to consider the broader implications of marijuana scheduling and take bold steps towards full legalization. This would reflect current scientific understanding and public opinion while promoting social equity, economic growth, and public health.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to further engaging on this important issue.

I am writing to express my strong support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. This is an important and necessary step towards modernizing our nation's drug policies, reflecting current scientific understanding of cannabis' potential benefits and harms.



For too long, marijuana has been categorized alongside highly dangerous substances like methamphetamine, despite mounting evidence suggesting its relative safety. Reclassifying it to Schedule III would not only acknowledge this reality but also pave the way for further research into its medicinal properties and potential risks.



Furthermore, reclassification would provide much-needed regulatory clarity for businesses operating within the burgeoning cannabis industry. The tax benefits that stand to accrue from such a move could stimulate economic growth and job creation in communities across America.



I urge you to consider these points as you review this critical proposal. Reclassifying marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act is a commonsense move that aligns with both public sentiment and scientific evidence. It represents another significant step forward in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy.

DEA-2024-0059-32324,2024-07-18T04:00Z,David Adams,"Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the DEA’s proposed rule on the status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). While I appreciate the Biden Administration’s efforts to reconsider marijuana’s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, I have deep concerns about the huge insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it’s time to END this country’s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA’s drug schedules. As a marijuana user, I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to DESCHEDULE marijuana from the CSA.

Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients’ access to medical marijuana. 

Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. For example, although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won’t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.

The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA, or “descheduling.” Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. 

Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana’s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. 

Moreover, for decades, the U.S. has played an instrumental role in creating and enforcing marijuana prohibition at the global level with devastating consequences around the world. With the changing realities at the domestic level comes a responsibility to start repairing the damage caused by prohibitionist policies and support initiatives that lead to systemic changes in the international arena. Consequently, the U.S. should undertake active diplomacy at the United Nations level together with like-minded countries to challenge the outdated global drug control regime.

Given the Biden Administration’s repeated acknowledgment of the racially discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws and related harms, any process by the Biden Administration to develop a new federal policy for marijuana without these considerations is unjustifiable.

President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden’s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,0.9986652785248988

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation.

We stand for the liberation of plant medicines and an end to patriarchal policies that disrupt sacramental, ceremonial and health sovereignty in Indigenous Communities in the United States, with an alternative demand for a Schedule V designation under the Controlled Substances Act.  

Additionally, the current proposal from a Schedule 1 to a Schedule 2 would undermine existing Tribal and State operated programs that have been intentionally set up with well-regulated policy and systems to protect consumer safety and prevent youth access. We are also concerned about the overtaxing of cannabis as medicine, which leads to an increase in illicit cannabis activities- even in cannabis regulating states. There is a need for additional data related to overtaxing of seed and plant medicine and agricultural commodities as a moral and ethical obligation towards the health sovereignty of all US Citizens.

Native American, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian healers all have a long pre-contact history of using Indigenous, or Native, plants for a wide variety of medicinal purposes. Medicinal plants and their applications are as diverse as the tribes who use them. In many Indigenous communities, there are recognized specialists trained in traditional medicine, and their practice often reflects spiritual aspects of healing as well as physical outcomes. In many cases, the therapeutic properties of Indigenous medicines are attributable to particular compounds and their effects on the body, but in other instances, their application is little understood by western medical practitioners.

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. Tribal Sovereigns are advancing clinical research on cannabis that is proving its efficacy, funded wholly by the Tribe and partnering with University Research systems.   

Scientific Evidence: 
Multiple studies and clinical trials have documented the therapeutic benefits of marijuana, reinforcing its status as a drug with accepted medical use. In 2023, the National Institute of Health published a research report describing how the Puyallup Tribe created a clinic specializing in cannabis-based treatments and partnered with a university research team to assess the impacts of cannabis on patient outcomes. Cannabis for Healing in a Native Community Clinic: Development and Results from an Informatics Research Tool.

Widespread Medical Acceptance: 
Marijuana is recognized for its medical use in numerous tribal communities and states across the U.S., demonstrating its efficacy in treating conditions like chronic pain, nausea, and more. This acceptance aligns with the requirements for Schedule V, which includes drugs with accepted medical uses. Additionally, Tribal Sovereigns are advancing clinical research on cannabis that is proving its efficacy.

The ICIA embraces policy that protects the rights of Tribes- especially from the intrusion of states- and supports Tribal clinical research, with a focus on Tribal Colleges and Universities and Land Grant Institutions serving American Indian communities. The future of tribal clinical data will be paramount to address health disparities and repair the harm caused over centuries.

In conclusion, the proposed policy statement represents a significant step towards harmonizing federal marijuana enforcement with Tribal sovereignty and local needs. With appropriate resources and collaborative efforts, this framework can effectively address public safety concerns and support Tribal efforts in regulating cannabis within their communities. Please also see the attached files and full record of statements, research/data and federal cannabis reform ideas that have been developed by Tribal Nations, in consultation with our elders, to plan for the next seven generations.

I am writing to express my strong support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. This is an important and necessary step towards modernizing our nation's drug policies, reflecting current scientific understanding of cannabis' potential benefits and harms.



For too long, marijuana has been categorized alongside highly dangerous substances like methamphetamine, despite mounting evidence suggesting its relative safety. Reclassifying it to Schedule III would not only acknowledge this reality but also pave the way for further research into its medicinal properties and potential risks.



Furthermore, reclassification would provide much-needed regulatory clarity for businesses operating within the burgeoning cannabis industry. The tax benefits that stand to accrue from such a move could stimulate economic growth and job creation in communities across America.



I urge you to consider these points as you review this critical proposal. Reclassifying marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act is a commonsense move that aligns with both public sentiment and scientific evidence. It represents another significant step forward in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy.



Thank you for your attention to this matter.

As a voter and a recreational cannabis user I urge the DEA to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act, which would be a step toward rectifying the harms caused by its criminalization. 
However, rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, as the DHSS  and the DEA have proposed, is insufficient. If cannabis remains on the CSA, people can still face penalties at the federal level for possession, including arrest and incarceration, which lead to a lifetime of severe negative consequences.

The criminalization of cannabis was a policy decision rooted in racism. In the decades since, its enforcement has been disproportionately targeted at Black people and other people of color. It’s time to abandon this racist policy.",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,0.7027325229105046
DEA-2024-0059-41890,2024-07-23T04:00Z,Anonymous,"I am providing comments in support of the reclassification of botanical cannabis (Docket No. DEA–1362).  The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain and anxiety, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision. Cannabis is currently classified as a Schedule I controlled substance under federal law, alongside drugs such as opium and fentanyl. This means that cannabis is wrongly considered to have no accepted medical use, a high potential for abuse and no accepted safety standards even under medical supervision. As a result, cannabis continues to be harshly criminalized.

The reality is that cannabis has widely accepted medical uses and a low potential for abuse. More than three-quarters of US states have legalized medical cannabis, a majority of doctors recognize a variety of medical uses for cannabis, and more than 50 million Americans use cannabis each year. According to the DEA’s own data, there has not been a single recorded cannabis overdose death.

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether – thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states – I nonetheless support the factual basis underlying HHS’ recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower. It would be arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to reject HHS’s findings of fact and to maintain existing prohibitions of the cannabis plant.

Plus, there are even more concerning problems with cannabis continuing to be classified as a Schedule 1 drug.  While most states have legalized the use of cannabis, at least when a patient has a clear medical necessity for the drug as determined by a licensed physician, some very conservative states have have made cannabis use illegal no matter what the circumstances.  For example, in Indiana, physician's cannot legally write cannabis prescriptions even if the medicine is warranted. Because of the fact that such states outlaw all use of cannabis in the state, a patient's right to care is taken away and a physician is not given the right to fully treat his patients.  And while some patients get around this by purchasing cannabis from a nearby state where it has been legalized, this places the patient at incredible risk of prosecution. Many opiods are prescribed over long periods, just like benzodiazepines are for certain conditions, but physicians have developed protocols to ensure their prescription regimens are followed and they know to watch for signs of abuse.  Thus, why should regulating cannabis be so difficult?  Yet changing cannabis to a class 3 if the first step towards giving patients back their right to care and doctors the right to provide it.

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.

It's not fun watching your son in psychosis.  He only tested positive for marijuana.  So you tell me.....do you think it's really smart to change it to a Scheduled III?

I am writing to register my opposition to the recommendation to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. 

Rescheduling marijuana would allow the marijuana industry to deduct normal business expenses, including advertising and marketing expenses. This would make the industry profitable and incentivize them to spend even more on advertising and marketing.  This would likely cause marijuana sales and the harms associated with marijuana use to rise in tandem. Big Tobacco taught us the deleterious impact of advertising on youth: the more teens are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely they are to start smoking. The same will be true with marijuana. The marijuana industry will undoubtedly take a page out of Big Tobacco’s marketing playbook, making marijuana use look glamorous and benign with celebrity endorsements, candy flavoring (already seen in marijuana edibles), product placement in movies, and more. Even without the expected deluge of ads and marketing, marijuana use is at an all-time high. Teen use of marijuana is at 30- year high, with more teens reporting smoking marijuana than tobacco. Among young adults 19 to 30, 26% used in the past month compared to 17% in 2011, and 11% were daily users, up from 6% in 2011. 

HHS' recommendation failed to account for actual/relative potential for abuse or harms associated with use. Contrary to popular narrative, marijuana can be addictive. In fact, as many as 1 in 3 past year marijuana users met the clinical criteria for Cannabis Use Disorder. People who self-medicate with marijuana are not exempt from becoming addicted. According to research at Massachusetts General Hospital, “using cannabis products to treat pain, anxiety and depression failed to improve these symptoms while doubling the risk of developing the addictive symptoms of cannabis use disorder.” 

With the exception of one study of medical marijuana patients in Maryland, the review from HHS failed to acknowledge or consider the link between marijuana and psychosis. This is especially concerning in light of the rising potency of marijuana. Daily users of marijuana over 10% THC are nearly five times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder than non-users. A 2023 study in Denmark determined that 30% of cases of schizophrenia among 21–30-year-old males could have been averted if cannabis use disorder had been prevented. A 2022 study found that hospital discharges for marijuana-associated psychosis were higher in states with legal marijuana, another precursor if those who push full-scale commercialization have their way. 

Marijuana use is especially concerning in young people, a factor HHS failed to adequately address. The National Center for Education Statistics said, “adolescent marijuana use has been associated with lower academic performance and a higher risk of dropping out of high school.”  Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, warns, “Youth who use marijuana regularly are more likely to have a hard time learning, problems remembering, and lower math and reading scores. These effects can last weeks after the last time they used marijuana.” Recognizing that much remains unknown about marijuana, NIDA noted, “researchers are still studying how long marijuana’s effects last and whether some changes may be permanent.” 

Finally, while some states recognize “medical marijuana” there is no currently accepted medical use. Unlike other drugs in Schedule III, marijuana is not FDA approved to treat or cure any disease and it is not available for prescription in any state. In 2023, the American Medical Association adopted a position statement that “encourages hospitals and health systems to: (a) not recommend patient use of non-FDA approved cannabis or cannabis-derived products within healthcare facilities until such time as federal laws or regulations permit its use; and (b) educate medical staffs on cannabis use, effects and cannabis withdrawal syndrome.”

Those who are trying to lobby to keep Cannabis in schedule I, are in a way supporting the black market--which does not card, or test, or prohibit sales that are laced with opiods that can kill with one dose.  Common sense shows the legal state market is doing more to limit teen use.

The CDC says that tabacco kills about 400,000 a year, and alcohol about 100,000, yet neither of these substances is on the CSA at all, and have zero medical application and high abuse potential.  Again, common sense shows that Cannabis(which kills no one) does not belong on the CSA at all, although schedule III is a good start!

It is long past time to end this country’s failed policy of criminalization and completely remove marijuana from the CSA’s drug schedules. 
The DEA must reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.

Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA in its entirety and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations,  immigration consequences,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients’ access to medical marijuana. 

Schedule III is insufficient- even for the marijuana industry. Although placing marijuana in Schedule III would remove the unfair and onerous federal tax penalties upon state-regulated marijuana businesses, it won’t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.

Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana’s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling.

These effects can last weeks after the last time they used marijuana.” Recognizing that much remains unknown about marijuana, NIDA noted, “researchers are still studying how long marijuana’s effects last and whether some changes may be permanent.” 

Finally, while some states recognize “medical marijuana” there is no currently accepted medical use. Unlike other drugs in Schedule III, marijuana is not FDA approved to treat or cure any disease and it is not available for prescription in any state. In 2023, the American Medical Association adopted a position statement that “encourages hospitals and health systems to: (a) not recommend patient use of non-FDA approved cannabis or cannabis-derived products within healthcare facilities until such time as federal laws or regulations permit its use; and (b) educate medical staffs on cannabis use, effects and cannabis withdrawal syndrome.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled.

It would be arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to reject HHS’s findings of fact and to maintain existing prohibitions of the cannabis plant.

I personally, use medical cannabis in the state of Maryland where it is legal to treat my chronic anxiety and depression. Since utilizing medical cannabis as a previous alcohol abuser, I was able to abstain completely from alcohol. Medical marijuana has given me more of a positive outlook on life and has provided some of the best care compared to prescribed medicine such as pills or even alcohol.  Additionally - I have not ever developed any sort of dependence on weed whereas with alcohol for example I have.  I personally rather inject something that is fully natural compared to pills where they are made in a manufactured way. Before I buy canabis, I do my due diligence and research the handling and processing done by farmers which is highly regulated. In my opinion, the marijuana industry is even more regulated than the prescription drug manufacturing industry, which given with scientific research, is more dangerous than marijuana i.e opioids. Additionally - I found that compared to I jesting alcohol, I have ZERO negative side effects to injecting marijuana, whereas, alcohol gives me SEVERE anxiety and depression as well as the dreaded hangover whereas I don’t get any of these negative side effects from marijuana. With that being said, marijuana, in my opinion, is far better than alcohol.

I urge the Drug Enforcement Agency to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act, a move that would mark a step toward rectifying the harms caused by its criminalization. 

By descheduling cannabis, the federal government would be following the lead of 31 states that have already decriminalized the drug. In fact, the majority of people in the U.S.—70 percent, according to a November 2023 Gallup poll—support cannabis legalization. 

But rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, as the Department of Health & Human Services and the DEA have proposed, is insufficient. If cannabis remains on the CSA, people can continue to face penalties at the federal level for possession, including arrest and incarceration, which lead to a lifetime of consequences that impact someone’s ability to secure employment, housing, public benefits, educational opportunities, and more. 

The criminalization of cannabis—a legacy of the War on Drugs—was a policy decision rooted in racism. In the decades since, its enforcement has been disproportionately targeted at Black people and other people of color. It’s time to abandon this draconian approach.

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

I am writing to express my strong support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. This is an important and necessary step towards modernizing our nation's drug policies, reflecting current scientific understanding of cannabis' potential benefits and harms.



For too long, marijuana has been categorized alongside highly dangerous substances like methamphetamine, despite mounting evidence suggesting its relative safety. Reclassifying it to Schedule III would not only acknowledge this reality but also pave the way for further research into its medicinal properties and potential risks.



Furthermore, reclassification would provide much-needed regulatory clarity for businesses operating within the burgeoning cannabis industry. The tax benefits that stand to accrue from such a move could stimulate economic growth and job creation in communities across America.



I urge you to consider these points as you review this critical proposal. Reclassifying marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act is a commonsense move that aligns with both public sentiment and scientific evidence. It represents another significant step forward in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy.



Classifying cannabis as a Schedule 1 drug with Herion, Acid, & other harder drugs had never made any sense

The Honorable Anne Milgram

Dear Administrator Milgram,

Subject: Recommendation for Rescheduling Marijuana to Schedule IV

I am writing to recommend that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) consider rescheduling marijuana to Schedule IV under the Controlled Substances Act, rather than to Schedule III. While I believe that complete descheduling of marijuana would be the most appropriate course of action, rescheduling to Schedule IV would be a significant and constructive first step. This recommendation is based on current scientific evidence, medical utility, and the comparative risk profile of marijuana relative to other substances within these schedules.

	1.	Medical Efficacy and Safety:
	•	Marijuana has demonstrated significant medical benefits for various conditions, including chronic pain, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis. The therapeutic value of marijuana is well-documented, and its risk profile is considered to be lower than many Schedule III drugs.
	•	Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule IV, which includes medications with a low potential for abuse and low risk of dependence, more accurately reflects its medical efficacy and safety profile. This classification would align with the categorization of other substances that have recognized medical uses and a relatively low potential for abuse.
	2.	Comparative Analysis with Schedule III Substances:
	•	Schedule III substances, such as anabolic steroids and certain opioids, present a higher potential for abuse and dependence than marijuana. These drugs can lead to significant physical and psychological dependence, whereas marijuana’s dependency risk is lower and less severe.
	•	By placing marijuana in Schedule IV, the DEA would acknowledge its lower abuse potential relative to Schedule III substances, thus ensuring more appropriate regulatory oversight and access for medical use.
	3.	Impact on Research and Medical Access:
	•	A Schedule IV classification would significantly ease research barriers, facilitating more extensive scientific studies and clinical trials. This would lead to a better understanding of marijuana’s therapeutic benefits and potential risks, contributing to more informed medical and policy decisions.
	•	Easier access to marijuana for medical purposes would benefit patients who rely on its therapeutic effects, particularly in states where medical marijuana programs are in place. This would also support consistency in state and federal regulations.
	4.	Public Health and Social Justice Considerations:
	•	Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule IV would support public health by reducing the stigma associated with its medical use and encouraging healthcare providers to consider it as a treatment option.
	•	It would also address some of the social justice issues related to the criminalization of marijuana, disproportionately affecting minority communities. A lower scheduling would reflect a more balanced approach to drug policy, focusing on health and wellness rather than punitive measures.

In conclusion, while complete descheduling of marijuana would better reflect its medical utility and low abuse potential, rescheduling it to Schedule IV is a significant step in the right direction. This change would support medical research, improve patient access to treatment, and contribute to a more rational and just drug policy framework.

Thank you for considering my recommendation. I appreciate the DEA’s efforts to reevaluate marijuana’s scheduling status and trust that my perspective will be taken into account in your decision-making process.

I am providing comments in support of the reclassification of botanical cannabis (Docket No. DEA–1362).

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether – thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states – I nonetheless do not oppose the factual basis underlying HHS’ recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower. It would be arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to reject HHS’s findings of fact and to maintain existing prohibitions of the cannabis plant.

I live in California, in Humboldt County.  For that reason, I urge the Drug Enforcement Agency to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act, a move that would mark a step toward rectifying the harms caused by its criminalization. One of the main problems of having some states legal and others not is the criminal activity involved in moving product from state to state.

By descheduling cannabis, the federal government would be following the lead of 31 states that have already decriminalized the drug. In fact, the majority of people in the U.S.—70 percent, according to a November 2023 Gallup poll—support cannabis legalization. Legalization would get criminal activity out of the way.

But rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, as the Department of Health & Human Services and the DEA have proposed, is insufficient. If cannabis remains on the CSA, people can continue to face penalties at the federal level for possession, including arrest and incarceration, which lead to a lifetime of consequences that impact someone’s ability to secure employment, housing, public benefits, educational opportunities, and more. 

The criminalization of cannabis—a legacy of the War on Drugs—was a policy decision rooted in racism. In the decades since, its enforcement has been disproportionately targeted at Black people and other people of color. It’s time to abandon this draconian approach.

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.

This is an important step toward a change in marijuana policy that addresses the decades-long discrimination against Black and Brown communities. 



Taking marijuana out of the same classification as more harmful substances like methamphetamine and heroin will give a huge boost to cannabis researchers and those in the cannabis business, and set the stage for further reparative measures for impacted communities.

EON's mission is to ensure equitable ownership and employment opportunities in the cannabis industry for Black and Brown communities targeted by the War on Drugs.

While we appreciate the Biden Administration’s efforts to reconsider marijuana’s inappropriate classification as a Schedule I controlled substance, we have deep concerns about the insufficiency of rescheduling. Instead of keeping marijuana illegal under the CSA, it’s time to end this country’s failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA's drug schedules. We urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and issue a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.

Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III is not enough. Marijuana must be removed from the CSA and should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. 

Rescheduling will not
-end federal marijuana criminalization
-end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use
-release anyone in prison for marijuana
-expunge previous marijuana arrests
-end deportations, immigration consequences, or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity
-restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity
-bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law
-guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry
-facilitate patients' access to medical marijuana

We applaud MA CCC Acting Chair Ava Callender Concepcion, Esq. and Commissioners Nurys Camargo, Kimberly Roy, and Bruce Stebbins for requesting “the DEA take steps to prioritize and assist those who have been disproportionately impacted by previous marijuana prohibition and enforcement” and emphatically echo that request.

If DEA moves forward with developing a new regulatory scheme for marijuana, we strongly encourage it to incorporate lessons from states like MA that show how this new industry can foster economic growth in underserved communities, support entrepreneurship and workforce development among people harmed by the war on drugs, encourage small businesses, and prevent dangerous monopolization with policies including:
Protections for existing state social equity programs and licensing schemes
Prioritization for businesses started by people from communities harmed by the war on drugs
Exclusivity period
1:1 licensing ratio between equity and non-equity licensees
Support for equity applicants and businesses 
Grant and loan programs
Education and training
Technical assistance
Access to existing small business assistance programs
Waived and reduced fees
Workforce development programs connecting justice-involved individuals to cannabis careers
Policies that encourage other agencies and state and local governments to encourage equitable participation
Requiring all market participants to develop plans to positively impact communities harmed by the war on drugs and hiring and contractor diversity plans

In the event the DEA moves forward as proposed rather than descheduling marijuana, we echo the CCC's request for ”additional steps to reconcile these differences and provide clear regulatory pathways, enhance public safety, and support the burgeoning cannabis industry.”

We further urge the Administration to partner with state regulators, labs, consumers, business owners, patients, physicians, people with marijuana convictions,  and other stakeholders to protect existing well-regulated marketplaces and support and protect restorative justice and other efforts to encourage equitable participation in the industry.

We appreciate the Administration's commitment to criminal justice reform, and one of the authors was one of the recipients of President Joe Biden's blanket pardon for federal possession. However, there is much more it should do through regulation and Executive Order, including:
Issuing guidance that prosecutions for cannabis-related conduct will be deprioritized, pardoning, releasing, and commuting sentences for people in prison because of marijuana prohibition; and ending cannabis-related deportations
Expanding pardons for cannabis-related offenses beyond simple possession, for both civilians and military, calling on states to do the same
Expressly stating the Administration's support for Congressional action to legalize cannabis with regulations that prioritize reparative justice and equitable economic opportunity and protect public health, consumers, workers, and state regulatory frameworks and equity programs

As the federal government begins to regulate marijuana, it must empower all relevant agencies to support small business development and prevent the monopolization of the industry or the influence of predatory industries (including tobacco, alcohol, pharmaceutical, and exploitive gig employers).

Numerous studies have shown that cannabis, while not the cure all, helps in the alleviation of symptoms related to various conditions. As a veteran who lives with depression, anxiety, CPTSD and chronic pain I have personal experience in using it as medication and it helps immensely with my symptoms in various ways; it calms me, it calms my physical pain, it keeps my thoughts from racing and stimulates my appetite when I'm too stressed to eat. These are all well documented and studied positive effects of cannabis. As far as recreational use goes, there are positive outcomes here as well; it relieves stress, calms people, people feel happier and are less likely to get aggressive unlike alcohol which is legal and sold up and down America's streets and neighborhoods.
With the lack of resources for mental health in our country and the difficulty in obtaining, prescribing medication; cannabis could help bridge that gap in access to care, it's time to stop demonizing/criminalizing a natural plant that holds a lot of promise for many people.

Rescheudling will accomplish little if we don’t provide protections, at the federal level, for patients with legitimately obtained medical marijuana prescriptions. This include protections from employment-based drug testing programs for medical marijuana that was obtained through a state-level doctor’s recommendation. 

Please ensure that state-level patients who  rely on this medication can still access it and use it, per doctors’ recommendation, without fear of reprisal from law-enforcement or their employer (both state and federal employees).

DEA-2024-0059-3923,2024-05-23T04:00Z,Spencer Bruce,"While the proposed rescheduling of cannabis is a step in the right direction, I am commenting in support of descheduling cannabis entirely. There are many strong descheduling cases to be made from the perspectives of criminal justice reform & racial equity, health & wellness (e.g. cannabis-based products replacing pharmaceuticals that are well known to be extremely harmful and addictive), and plain old common sense. 

While fully in support of those arguments, I will leave them to the experts on such topics- I am writing this comment as someone whose business and personal life is currently controlled and negatively impacted by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration under authority of the US Department of Transportation. Under FMCSA, my business is required to conduct random and post-accident drug testing on all of our employees, including urinalysis testing for THC. I am fully in support of common sense regulation of substance use and abuse for commercial vehicle operators and other safety-sensitive roles, but current policy is egregiously burdensome, unfair, and lacks any scientific backing. 

Recreational cannabis is fully legal in the state in which we do business. It is just as easy and legal for myself or any of my employees to purchase cannabis as it is to purchase a six-pack of beer. Under current regulations, one of my employees could not use a cannabis product during their off time and return to duty on their next scheduled work day without fear of losing their job, or potentially worse- having our insurance deny a claim due to a failed drug test. 

Testing for inactive cannabanoids that are present in the human body for weeks or months after last cannabis usage is insanity. Cannabis use is much less harmful to short and long term health than alcohol or other legal and illegal drugs. Someone could consume 10 alcoholic drinks per night and be legal to drive a commercial vehicle by morning; yet an edible cannabis product consumed off-duty during vacation is cause for someone to be terminated from their job. Someone could use cocaine all weekend and produce a clean urine sample by Monday or Tuesday, yet that cannabis joint shared among friends three weekends ago is cause enough to deny an insurance claim.

There is no moral, scientific, or safety-focused justification for current DOT drug testing policy with respect to cannabis. I would much prefer that any of my employees use cannabis over alcohol, for both their own long-term health and their ability to safely carry out the duties of their jobs. Cannabis reform must continue until DOT drug policy is aligned with science. ",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,0.2101248381073155

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

I suffer from fibromyalgia, insomnia, ADHD, anxiety and depression. Cannabis helps me manage all these issues to some degree. I used to use alcohol to get to sleep every night, which isn't a great remedy, until cannabis was legalized in WA state. Now I use cannabis, a much gentler and more effective remedy. CBD-dominant strains help me deal with pain, without damaging my liver with NSAIDs. Cannabis is such a versatile, useful, beneficial substance. Please make it easier for all adults to access.

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether – thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states – I nonetheless do not oppose the factual basis underlying HHS’ recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower.

As a primary care physician, I believe that medically supervised marijuana has much to offer our armamentarium of treatments.  The work of Professor Raphael Mechoulam has demonstrated the myriad benefits of tetrahydrocannabinol and endogenous cannabinoids.  Clinician Dustin Sulak, D.O., has even written a textbook for physicians, documenting his effective use of medical cannabis for conditions ranging from ADD to anxiety, to cancer and pain management—better results, in fact, than those obtained by many patients who failed conventional pharmaceutical therapeutics.  Mastering skillful administration of these powerful substances could obviate the need for toxic pharmaceuticals—and it is my belief that this is why Big Pharma is pressuring government agencies to oppose rescheduling cannabis.  Aside from all the clinical considerations, placement in Schedule I does not even allow the very research that would further prove its efficacy and safety!

Thank you for allowing me to comment on the current status of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). I am concerned about the insufficiency of rescheduling. It’s time to end this failed policy of criminalization by completely removing marijuana from the CSA’s drug schedules. I urge the DEA to reconsider its proposed rule and create a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA. 

Marijuana must be removed from the CSA in its entirety, and it should be federally regulated for both medical and adult use. Simply rescheduling marijuana will not end federal marijuana criminalization. Rescheduling will not end federal marijuana arrests, even for possession and use. Rescheduling will not release anyone in prison for marijuana. Rescheduling will not expunge previous marijuana arrests. Rescheduling will not end deportations, immigration issues,or tourist visa restrictions stemming from marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not restore access to government benefits that people have lost due to marijuana activity. Rescheduling will not bring state marijuana programs into compliance with federal law. Rescheduling will not guarantee fair working conditions for individuals working in the marijuana industry. Rescheduling will not facilitate patients’ access to medical marijuana. 

Overall, Schedule III is insufficient, even for the marijuana industry. It won’t give them legal access to essential business services and is unlikely to result in significant wage increases for workers or lower prices for patients and consumers. More importantly, rescheduling marijuana would continue the criminalization of most marijuana activity occurring in the United States such as personal possession, cultivation, use, and participation in state-legal marijuana businesses and programs.

The only way to end federal marijuana criminalization and its harms is to completely remove marijuana from the CSA. I am a retired registered nurse and have seen how effective marijuana consumption is for treating many symptoms patients suffer as the result of illness and disease. Guided by principles of public health and equity, a new federal marijuana policy should seek to end unjust criminal legal consequences for marijuana activity, restore rights and opportunities for individuals and communities targeted by marijuana criminalization, and ensure a diverse marketplace by protecting small businesses and equity programs from the emergence of national and multinational corporate monopolies. 

Not only is the outcome of Schedule III insufficient, the process of evaluating marijuana’s status on the CSA is also flawed. The administrative review process conducted by the FDA and DEA is, by design, limited in scope and fails to consider the racist origins and impacts of marijuana prohibition which have produced overwhelming negative social, economic, and public health consequences. These generational outcomes are still felt by predominantly Black and Latino communities experiencing mass incarceration, inaccessible public housing, and denial of food assistance programs, among other detrimental consequences that will continue under marijuana rescheduling. 

President Biden has repeatedly promised to decriminalize marijuana. I call on the DEA not to undermine President Biden’s campaign pledge by finalizing the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana under the CSA. It is imperative for the Biden Administration to follow through on this unfulfilled commitment by taking action now to end and repair the harms of federal marijuana criminalization. Because rescheduling marijuana fails to accomplish this, I urge the DEA to reconsider this proposed rule and replace it with a new rule to deschedule marijuana from the CSA.

DEA-2024-0059-32363,2024-07-18T04:00Z,Daniel Baker,"RE: Docket No. DEA-1362

I am writing to express my strong opposition to the recent proposal by the Justice Department to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I substance to a Schedule III substance under the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA). This proposed change represents a significant shift in federal drug policy with significant implications for public safety, public health and the ability of police agencies to protect the public. 

In particular, I am concerned about the following impacts: 

Public Safety Risks: Studies have consistently shown that marijuana use impairs perception, coordination, and judgment, significantly increasing the risk of accidents and fatalities on roadways. States that have legalized recreational marijuana, such as Colorado, have experienced notable increases in collision claim frequencies and marijuana-related traffic deaths. 

Policing Challenges: Despite claims that reclassification might alleviate police leaders from burdens related to marijuana possession, the proposal fails to address the complexities of distinguishing between lawful medical use and unauthorized recreational consumption. Apparent and standardized guidelines and comprehensive training for law enforcement personnel must be revised to mitigate the inherent ambiguities and enforcement challenges.

Youth and Health Impacts: Of particular concern is the impact of marijuana on adolescent and young adult populations. Research indicates that marijuana use during crucial developmental stages can lead to lasting adverse effects on brain development, including lowered IQ and increased susceptibility to mental health disorders such as depression and schizophrenia. 

Impaired Driving: Marijuana’s psychoactive effects can impair cognitive and motor functions critical for safe driving, posing risks to road safety even under a Schedule III classification. Addressing impaired driving concerns necessitates continued vigilance in enforcement, public education, and prevention efforts to mitigate potential harms.  

Lack of Testing/Legal Standards for Impairment: The lack of a reliable marijuana impairment test presents significant challenges for police officers. Unlike alcohol, where a breathalyzer can provide a relatively accurate measure of impairment, no such tool currently exists for marijuana. This makes it difficult for officers to determine whether a driver is under the influence of marijuana, leading to safety risks on the road. In addition, the lack of a legal standard for marijuana impairment poses a further complication for police agencies.  With alcohol, a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08% is widely accepted as the threshold for impairment. However, no such consensus exists for marijuana.  Both factors significantly complicate legal proceedings. Without concrete evidence of impairment, it can be difficult to secure convictions in cases of driving under the influence of marijuana. This can lead to impaired drivers escaping punishment, further endangering roadway safety.

Potential Impact on Current Firearms Regulations:  Currently, 18 USC § 923 (g) (3) makes it unlawful for anyone who is a an “unlawful user or addicted to any controlled substance” to “possess … any firearm or ammunition.”  Many police agencies in states that have legalized the use of recreational or medical marijuana have relied on this regulation to maintain policies that prohibit police officers from using marijuana.  There is significant concern that the federal rescheduling of marijuana may limit the ability of police agencies to prevent marijuana usage by their officers. 

Diversion Potential: The reclassification raises significant concerns about diversion risks, particularly if regulatory oversight and enforcement measures are not adequately strengthened. Ensuring that marijuana intended for medical purposes does not contribute to illicit markets or non-medical use requires robust regulatory frameworks and effective enforcement strategies.

In conclusion, I strongly oppose the proposed rescheduling of Marijuana and urge the adoption of, or continuation of, policies and regulations that prioritize public health and safety.  After my Dayton police career I was a licensed drug rehab counselor.  The effect of the drug was always harmful to patients and easily led to relapse due to wide availability and permissive attitudes  that are going to be even more impactful on ALL ages.  A major threat indeed.  Dan Baker DPD",Opposed,0.2288510786109096

I am writing in support of rescheduling botanical marijuana to Schedule III or lower (Docket No. DEA–1362). Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and has a far lower potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs, including fentanyl, oxycodone, and morphine. It also has a lower abuse potential and a lower level of physical or psychological dependence than alcohol, which is not scheduled. 

41 states have medical cannabis or lower-THC medical cannabis laws, pursuant to which tens of thousands of prescribers have certified millions of patients for medical cannabis. Although federal policies and the massive amount of funding necessary for large-scale clinical trials have created obstacles to clinical trials, numerous studies provide credible evidence for the medical value of cannabis.

In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report after a review of thousands of abstracts on medical cannabis research. It found, “[T]he use of cannabis for the treatment of pain is supported by well-controlled clinical trials...” and “There is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults.” 

Botanical cannabis does not cause respiratory depression, which causes thousands of fatal overdoses each year from other drugs, including opioids, alcohol, and some over-the-counter medications. More than 14,000 Americans fatally overdosed on prescription opiates each year from 2017-2022 according to NIDA. The CDC reports that each year 178,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use, including over 2,600 deaths from alcohol poisoning. In contrast, suspected fatal overdoses on cannabis are vanishingly rare. 

While some people develop a dependence on cannabis, it is relatively mild compared to  Schedule II drugs and alcohol. Withdrawal from alcohol and opiates can be fatal. The National Academies report noted cannabis withdrawal can include, “restlessness, irritability, mild agitation, insomnia, sleep disturbance, nausea, and cramping — uncomfortable sensations, to be sure, but far milder than symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal.”

Humanity has been aware of cannabis’ medical benefits for thousands of years. Since 1970, U.S. federal law has ignored this reality, ignoring the lived experience of people with cancer and AIDS who found relief from wasting and nausea, those suffering from chronic pain, and many others. The American Nurses Association has supported allowing medical cannabis since 1996. Numerous health organizations have joined the ANA, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the U.S. Pain Foundation, and the Epilepsy Foundation. A 2022 survey authored by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers found that 69% of practicing physicians believe cannabis has medical value. 

Cannabis has currently accepted medical use and far less potential for abuse than Schedule II drugs. It should be rescheduled to III or lower. It would be even more appropriate to deschedule cannabis, since it also has far lower potential for abuse than alcohol.

Thank you for considering this important step forward towards a more sensible approach on federal cannabis policy.

The Department of Health and Human Services appropriately concluded that cannabis “has a currently accepted medical use” and that its abuse potential does not warrant its placement as either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance.

HHS reached this determination because there exists a widespread understanding in the medical community that cannabis has a legitimate use in the treatment of specific conditions, including pain, and that it can be administered comparatively safely under medical supervision.

Thirty-eight states regulate the production and sale of botanical cannabis and related products to eligible patients. An estimated six million patients currently participate in these programs, as do some 30,000 healthcare practitioners. Many of these state access programs have been operating for several decades. No state has ever repealed patients’ access to plant-derived medical cannabis products. This is clear evidence that medical cannabis can be regulated safely and effectively, and that its public health benefits far outweigh any costs. 

Nationwide, 69 percent of practicing clinicians believe that cannabis has medical utility, and more than one-quarter acknowledge having recommended cannabis to their patients, according to 2022 survey data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, several medical societies and associations, such as the American Nurses Association and the American Public Health Association, are on record urging the federal government to “move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine.”

Cannabis possesses a superior safety profile as compared to many other controlled substances and it clearly does not meet the strict requirements of either a Schedule I or a Schedule II controlled substance. Specifically, HHS determined, “The risks to the public health posed by marijuana are low compared to other drugs of abuse,” such as benzodiazepines — a Schedule IV drug, or alcohol, which is unscheduled. HHS concluded, “No safety concerns were identified in our review that would indicate that the medical use of marijuana poses unacceptably high safety risks for the indications where there is some credible scientific evidence supporting its therapeutic use.”

I am have been prescribed narcotic drugs and medical cannabis. I do not like the side effects and addictive effects of narcotics. I have found that cannabis is more beneficial in being able to continue to be productive to be able to work and live while being able to manage my pain and stress levels. 

In conclusion, cannabis clearly does not meet the necessary criteria of either a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. While I believe cannabis should be removed from the CSA altogether – thereby harmonizing federal cannabis policy with those of most US states – I nonetheless do not oppose the factual basis underlying HHS’ recommendation to move botanical cannabis to Schedule III or lower. It would be arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to reject HHS’s findings of fact and to maintain existing prohibitions of the cannabis plant.",Supports Beyond Schedule 3,0.9387341961681548

I am writing to express my strong support for the proposal to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. This is an important and necessary step towards modernizing our nation's drug policies, reflecting current scientific understanding of cannabis' potential benefits and harms.



For too long, marijuana has been categorized alongside highly dangerous substances like methamphetamine, despite mounting evidence suggesting its relative safety. Reclassifying it to Schedule III would not only acknowledge this reality but also pave the way for further research into its medicinal properties and potential risks.



Furthermore, reclassification would provide much-needed regulatory clarity for businesses operating within the burgeoning cannabis industry. The tax benefits that stand to accrue from such a move could stimulate economic growth and job creation in communities across America.



I urge you to consider these points as you review this critical proposal. Reclassifying marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act is a commonsense move that aligns with both public sentiment and scientific evidence. It represents another significant step forward in our ongoing efforts to reform and modernize U.S. drug policy.



Thank you for your attention to this matter.

I have personal experience using cannabis as a medical substance in three different scenarios. 

One I eliminated a skin cancer on my forehead with the oils extracted from whole flower plant material. I had no adverse reactions whatsoever. 
Two. I saw my daughter, who was undergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer, obtain immediate relief from nausea after smoking cannabis.  The four other medications that were prescribed were totally ineffective and caused numerous complications. There were no adverse reactions whatsoever. Further, it allowed her to sleep... a critical element of recovery from any illness.
three. My wife currently takes cannabis gummies for pain relief from neck surgery. This has allowed her to drastically reduce her need for prescription pain medication which was causing numerous intestinal, quality of life and other physical complications and degradation. She is recovering much better with the use of these gummies with no adverse effects whatsoever. 

As you can see, from my personal, direct experience, there is no reason that cannabis should be classified as a Schedule 1 drug. I would think that this plant is less dangerous than aspirin. 

Regarding addictive potential: I felt no psychotic effects from the oil I put on my forehead; My daughter did not like the ""high"" feeling of  cannabis and only used it for it's therapeutic effects; and my wife uses it in varying amounts depending on her pain and planned activities. None of have experienced any addictive properties whatsoever.
